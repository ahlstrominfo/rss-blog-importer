<p>Today, when you write code, other developers review it before it gets merged. They need to understand your logic, your variable names, your approach. Because they might need to work with this code later.</p>
<p>But when AI generates the code, what exactly are we reviewing?</p>
<p>Maybe ownership becomes about tests and requirements instead of implementations.</p>
<p>You own the test suite that defines what the system should do. You own the performance benchmarks. You own the specification that describes the problem we’re solving.</p>
<p>Someone else might run the same tests and get completely different generated code. That’s fine as long as it passes the same validation.</p>
<p>This changes everything. Instead of “Who wrote this function?” the question becomes “Who defined these requirements?” Instead of debugging someone’s implementation, you’re questioning whether the test suite covers the right scenarios.</p>
<p>The skill becomes problem definition rather than problem solving through code.</p>

                    <title>The holdout test</title>
                    <link>https://mattias.blog/the-holdout-test</link>
                    <description>In machine learning, you hold back some data that the model never sees during training. This lets you check if the model actually learned the pattern or just memorized the examples. We might need the same thing for AI-generated code. Right now, most of our tests are “public”. The AI can see them, learn from them, and optimize for them. This works for basic functionality. But it creates a risk.

<p>We might need the same thing for AI-generated code.</p>
<p>Right now, most of our tests are “public”. The AI can see them, learn from them, and optimize for them. This works for basic functionality. But it creates a risk.</p>
<p>The AI might generate code that passes all your tests but doesn’t actually solve the problem. Like writing an if statement for every number between 1 and 2000 instead of using a proper algorithm.</p>
<p>The code technically works. It passes your tests. But it’s brittle and will break the moment you need to handle 2001.</p>
<p>So we need two types of tests. Public tests that guide the AI toward the right solution. And private tests that the AI never sees.</p>
<p>The private tests are your real validation. They test the business logic that actually matters. They try malformed inputs, edge cases, performance under load. They check whether the solution actually works, not just whether it responds correctly to known inputs.</p>
<p>This creates a new discipline. Someone needs to write these holdout tests. Someone who understands the domain deeply enough to know how the system might fail in the real world.</p>
<p>The AI helps with implementation. Humans focus on validation.</p>

                    <title>When code reviews become obsolete</title>
                    <link>https://mattias.blog/when-code-reviews-become-obsolete</link>
                    <description>We spend so much time in code reviews arguing about implementation details. Should this be a map or a loop? Why did you use this pattern instead of that one? Is this variable name clear enough? These conversations made sense when humans were writing all the code.

<p>These conversations made sense when humans were writing all the code. Understanding someone else’s implementation is crucial because you might need to maintain it, debug it, or extend it later.</p>
<p>But what happens when AI generates the code?</p>
<p>I can ask an AI agent to build an API that talks to a database, processes the data, and serves it to the frontend. The code works. The tests pass. But the implementation might be completely different each time I generate it.</p>
<p>Will this matter?</p>
<p>The conversation shifts. We’re not debating whether to use a for loop or a map. We’re debating whether we tested the edge case where users upload malformed data. Whether our performance benchmarks actually reflect real usage patterns.</p>
<p>Maybe developers will keep writing code that matters. But the code that controls what users see won’t be the implementation. It will be the tests.</p>

                    <description>I printed 160 pages of Java documentation on my school printer in 1998. Sneakily. Downloaded the JDK over a 56k modem connection that took forever. Set everything up exactly as instructed. Then I wrote my first line of code and hit run. Error message. Cryptic, broken English that meant nothing to me. So I uninstalled everything and downloaded it again, burning more precious bandwidth and time. Same error. Same confusion. I gave up on Java that day.

<p>I gave up on Java that day.</p>
<p>Years later I tried PHP with the LAMP stack. Wrote some code, refreshed my browser, and it worked immediately.</p>
<p>When you’re new to something, you need feedback that tells you whether you’re moving in the right direction or completely lost. You need signals you can actually decode. Whether that feedback comes from the system responding to your code, a person explaining what went wrong, or even just seeing your idea work for the first time.</p>
<p>Without those clear signals early on, momentum dies before it ever builds.</p>

<p>We tell ourselves we’re being strategic. Building momentum. Getting organized.</p>

<p>The hard thing is hard because we might fail at it. Because we don’t know how to do it yet. Because it requires us to learn something new or uncomfortable.</p>
<p>So we leave it for later. When we’re “ready.”</p>
<p>But later never comes. Or when it does, we’re already committed. The project has momentum. People are expecting results. Changing course feels impossible.</p>
<p>We’re pot committed to a solution that doesn’t solve the real problem.</p>
<p>Start with the thing we least want to do.</p>
<p>The uncomfortable conversation. The technical challenge you’ve never attempted. The skill you need to learn.</p>
<p>Do that first.</p>

                    <description>Sometimes people don’t want advice. Sometimes people don’t want feedback. Sometimes people don’t want to learn. Sometimes people don’t want to get monetized. And it’s okay. You might not be the audience. The urge to help is natural. It’s also often misplaced. This isn’t about them being closed-minded. It’s about you not being their audience. The most generous thing you can do sometimes is witness someone’s experience without trying to change it. You don’t have to be relevant to everyone.</description>

                    <description>When you are aiming at being around much longer than Q4 next year, you should focus on the trends rather than quick wins. Quick wins feel good in the moment but they rarely compound. Building something that lasts means accepting slower progress today for exponential returns tomorrow. The companies and people who outlast their competition aren’t chasing the next quarter’s numbers.</description>

                    <description>I’ve spent countless hours watching Vinh Giang content. One of his best insights is that you should use your voice like a piano. That most people only use one key when they speak. Same tone. Same pitch. Same volume. It sounds monotone because it is monotone. A piano has 88 keys for a reason. Learn to use them all. Like a pianist knows exactly which key creates the feeling they want. Your voice can do the same.</description>

                    <description>I used to hang out at this record store when I was younger. Buying cd after cd. Not because I needed them all but because each purchase felt like proof I belonged there. The synthesizer store was the same. I’d walk in and buy something just to have that moment of connection. To be part of the conversation. “What have you bought? Look at this awesome thing.” We buy our way into communities. The transaction becomes the handshake. The receipt becomes the membership card.

<p>We buy our way into communities. The transaction becomes the handshake. The receipt becomes the membership card.</p>
<p>Sometimes the willingness to belong costs more than we planned to spend. But maybe that’s the price of finding your people.</p>

                    <description>I write a prompt. Claude Code generates a markdown file with a solution. I read it, adapt it to my needs, then check that refined specification into git. Many developers craft detailed prompts, get generated code back, then delete the prompt and keep only the implementation. These adapted markdown files contain the real intent. The code contains one possible expression of that intent. The code will change. The intent remains. So version control your thinking, not just your implementations.</description>

                    <description>We gather to watch something together. Everyone pulls out their phone. The shared screen becomes permission for individual escape.

<p>Take the keyboard. This oddly arranged collection of keys exists because of a mechanical limitation from over a century ago. Typewriter keys would jam if you typed too quickly on adjacent letters, so the QWERTY layout deliberately slowed typists down.</p>
<p>Why haven’t we escaped this antiquated design in the nearly 40 years since typewriters became obsolete?</p>
<p>Often it’s because these behaviors become so deeply embedded in our culture that we stop questioning whether better alternatives exist. We train the next generation using the same methods without pausing to ask: is this actually the best way?</p>

<p>The best developers I’ve worked with have been those who understood messy, complex business problems and figured out how to break them down into logical, implementable pieces. The code was just the way we communicated this process to the computer.</p>
<p>We’ve seen this pattern before. As people mastered each layer of abstraction, it enabled others to work at higher levels. AI code generation is just the next step in that evolution.</p>
<p>Yet AI makes domain expertise more valuable, not less. The developers getting the best results aren’t beginners trying to skip the learning curve. They’re experienced engineers who can quickly spot when AI generates something that looks right but will cause performance issues at scale.</p>
<p>Perhaps those who struggle with AI identify as “code writers” rather than “problem solvers”? As long as we position ourselves as just the people who translate requirements into code, we’ll get typecast out of the conversations about what should be built and why.</p>

<p>I could have walked into the team meeting asking who screwed up. I’d seen other managers do exactly that. They immediately shift focus to finding the guilty party. But I’d developed a different habit over the years, partly from reading the book “Crucial Conversations” and partly from watching blame shifting destroy teams.</p>
<p>Facts first: “We released version X. It has this specific bug. Here’s what we know about impact.” No interpretation, no context, no excuses. Just what actually happened.</p>
<p>Then feelings: “This makes us look incompetent. Leadership is annoyed. I feel like I’ve lost credibility.” The stuff everyone was feeling but afraid to say out loud.</p>
<p>Finally, the future: “What needs to change so this doesn’t happen again?”</p>
<p>What surprised me was how quickly the conversation shifted from blame to problem solving. Not because I had some master plan, but because facts-feelings-future kept us focused on what we could actually control.</p>
<p>The same pattern works when stakes are higher too. When someone crosses a line, you still start the same way: “This is what you said. This is how it made people feel. This needs to stop.” But whether it ends with boundary setting or process changes depends on what actually happened.</p>

<p>I realized I experience the complete opposite when building products. Speed makes me lose sight of the minutiae that actually matter. Those edge cases that seem trivial in the moment. The quiet concerns someone has after the meeting ends and the decision is already made.</p>
<p>When we’re moving fast, we barrel through what feels like flat ground. We miss the small friction points that will trip us up later. The user who doesn’t fit our happy path. The integration that works perfectly until it doesn’t. The team member who nods in the room but has doubts they never voice.</p>
<p>Speed doesn’t just change how fast we ship. It changes what we perceive as obstacles. Running teaches you that every slight incline matters. Building products fast teaches you to ignore the inclines entirely.</p>

When you know your favourite restaurant is expanding, that the division 4 football team won last Friday, that there’s construction on the bridge that cuts your travel by 30 minutes. You’re not just informed. When you run into your neighbor at the grocery store and mention the restaurant expansion, you’re not making small talk. You’re connecting over what matters here.

<p>You’ve probably seen the meme: “How to draw an owl.” Step 1: Draw some basic shapes. Step 2: Draw the rest of the owl.</p>
<p>We want the shortcut to the final result. Skip the messy middle steps and jump straight to a polished business plan, product spec or marketing strategy.</p>
<p>The problem is that if you don’t know what a good owl looks like, you can’t tell whether AI has drawn one successfully.</p>
<p>If you’ve never written a business plan yourself, you won’t recognize when a generated one lacks crucial financial assumptions, market analysis or risk assessments.</p>
<p>AI makes domain expertise more valuable, not less. The people getting the best results from AI aren’t beginners trying to skip the learning curve. They’re experts who understand the intent behind every section.</p>
<p>We can’t just learn to prompt better. We need to understand what good looks like in the first place.</p>

                    <description>In an age of instant everything, the most valuable thing we can offer is our time, our attention, our humanity. This spring, we had a patch of bare dirt where we used to keep rabbits. Instead of planting grass seeds for a quick fix, we chose wildflower seeds. I watch bees and butterflies move deliberately from bloom to bloom. The bees don’t hurry. The butterflies don’t multitask. This attention and presence might be all we can compete with.

                    <description>If your change depends on having enough willpower or feeling motivated, it’s probably doomed since both run out when you need them most. Make your change part of a system to make it stick. A great system is attaching something to an already formed habit. I listen to podcasts in an app where I can save a snippet of the conversation with ease. But that snippet alone might not trigger the same idea when I read it back.

<p>Make your change part of a system to make it stick. A great system is attaching something to an already formed habit.</p>
<p>I listen to podcasts in an app where I can save a snippet of the conversation with ease. But that snippet alone might not trigger the same idea when I read it back. So I’ve attached the habit of adding a small note that starts with “This is interesting to me because…” That way I can get back to the state I was in when listening.</p>
<p>Another example: whenever I want to exercise in the morning, I need to put my workout clothes out the evening before. It’s a small mental shift that makes it easier. I’m not relying on morning motivation to overcome the small barrier of finding workout clothes. I’m eliminating that decision point entirely.</p>
<p>When looking to create a new habit, find the micro habit to attach it to. Instead of fighting your human nature, you’re designing around it.</p>

                    <description>Starting a new role creates this weird pressure to prove yourself quickly. As a new engineer you want to commit something. As a project manager you want to ship a feature. As a manager you want to make decisions. The instinct is to move fast and show progress. But the way to actually learn and succeed is different. You need to understand the problem well enough that you can explain it to others. Then make a plan on how to solve it. Then get feedback on that idea. This feels counterintuitive...</description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Starting a new role creates this weird pressure to prove yourself quickly.</p>
<p>As a new engineer you want to commit something. As a project manager you want to ship a feature. As a manager you want to make decisions. The instinct is to move fast and show progress.</p>
<p>But the way to actually learn and succeed is different. You need to understand the problem well enough that you can explain it to others. Then make a plan on how to solve it. Then get feedback on that idea.</p>
<p>This feels counterintuitive when you’re new. It feels like you’re not doing anything. But it’s what actually works.</p>
<p>If you manage or coach people, this is something you have to make explicit. You can’t assume they know this.</p>
<p>Tell them: you’re new here. Your focus right now is to understand this role and these challenges. I want you to be able to explain them back to me.</p>
<p>Then depending on their level, you’ll need different amounts of handholding. Junior people need you to walk them through what understanding actually looks like. Senior people need permission to slow down and think. Experienced people in new domains need help knowing what questions to ask.</p>
<p>The pressure to ship something fast is real. But the people who succeed long-term are the ones who understand deeply first.</p>

You can’t skip the meeting where your project might get discussed. When everyone thinks that way, every meeting becomes overcrowded with people who don’t need to be there.

<p>My technical opinions suddenly carried weight I didn’t intend them to have.</p>
<p>As a senior engineer, I had strong opinions about solutions and advocated for them. That was my job.</p>
<p>But as a manager, people sometimes stopped pushing back. They saw me as someone whose technical judgment could affect their careers.</p>
<p>This is mimetic desire in action. People copy what they think successful people want.</p>
<p>I lost access to the discussions that lead to better solutions. Junior developers stayed quiet. The collaborative tension that makes teams stronger disappeared.</p>
<p>I learned that being “right” about the technical solution mattered less than having the team bought into whatever we chose.</p>
<p>Your job isn’t to have the best technical opinions anymore. It’s to make sure the best technical opinions get heard.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​</p>

Everything is black and white, good patterns and bad patterns, right ways and wrong ways. But time smooths those edges.

<p>Sure, there’s hype around AI. But adoption is driven by technology solving real problems within existing workflows. That’s a completely different starting point than VR’s demand for behavior change.</p>
<p>Maybe the question isn’t whether AI goes the same way as VR, but which AI applications actually stick and which are just hype.</p>

                    <description>A few years ago I tried to teach my kids how to play chess. Trying to learn them all the moves and how to think ahead. The concept of “where do you want to be in a few moves?” was somewhat complicated to grasp. But once you understand it, everything changes. The better you are at predicting where you want your opponent in the future, the better you are at moving towards it. But you can’t just jump straight to checkmate.

<p>But once you understand it, everything changes. The better you are at predicting where you want your opponent in the future, the better you are at moving towards it. But you can’t just jump straight to checkmate. You need to plan the moves in between.</p>
<p>The same applies to developing using AI.</p>
<p>You need to think iteratively. Where do you want to move your pieces? In which direction?</p>
<p>The difference with chess is that your opponent really wants you to win. It can eagerly move its pawns to where it thinks would benefit you.</p>
<p>But it might not.</p>
<p>Just like chess, the more experience you have and the better your skills, the better player you are. The same applies to developing using AI. The more skills you have in development and thinking in systems, the better you’ll be at guiding it.</p>
<p>We invented chess computers that can think ahead. Building AI that can do iterative thinking is just the next step. So expect improvements but maybe not exact results.</p>

                    <link>https://mattias.blog/meeting-theater</link>
                    <description>About 10 years ago an agile coach introduced me to this concept: meeting theater. He was talking about scrum ceremonies. Teams going through daily standups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives because the framework said so. Not because it moved anything forward. A fake display of productivity with no progress. Throughout my career I’ve been watching organizations that struggle to ship. Management teams spend 8 hours a day in meetings.

<p>He was talking about scrum ceremonies. Teams going through daily standups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives because the framework said so. Not because it moved anything forward. A fake display of productivity with no progress.</p>
<p>Throughout my career I’ve been watching organizations that struggle to ship.</p>
<p>Management teams spend 8 hours a day in meetings. The calendar looks impressive, packed with important-sounding work.</p>
<p>But nothing gets built.</p>
<p>Meeting theater feels productive. That’s the trap. But those decisions need execution, and execution needs uninterrupted time.</p>
<p>The busy schedule becomes proof of importance. The full calendar signals commitment.</p>
<p>Someone has to write the code, ship the product. That someone isn’t in meetings all day.</p>
<p>The real work happens when people can focus. When they can solve problems instead of talking about solving problems.</p>
<p>But talking about work feels like work.</p>
<p>So the theater continues.</p>

<p>We’re unconsciously adapting our natural communication patterns to be more “AI-friendly.”</p>
<p>The intelligence level of the AI almost doesn’t matter. Once these tools enter our workflows, they inevitably alter the fundamental patterns of how we interact with information and each other.</p>
<p>We’re not just using AI. We’re being shaped by it.</p>

<p>Nobody designed for that. But it’s happening.</p>
<p>These tools are conducting unplanned experiments in communication patterns and social dynamics, with outcomes nobody anticipated.</p>

<p>I now vet ideas there first for any upfront stupidity.</p>
<p>That’s a new step in my thinking process. I’ve essentially added a rubber duck that talks back. It probably changes not just what ideas I present to people, but how I formulate ideas in the first place.</p>
<p>Some of the best insights come from someone saying something half-baked and another person going “wait, that’s actually interesting if we think about it this way…”</p>
<p>But if you’ve already filtered out the half-baked idea through AI, those generative moments never happen.</p>
<p>You get more polished inputs. But you lose those weird random leaps that lead somewhere unexpected.</p>
<p>The trick is knowing when to use the filter and when to let the half-baked ideas fly.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>What I really like about Lovable’s new moves is that they’re pivoting toward a model where they no longer fully depend on third-party APIs.</p>
<p>I’ve seen this dependency problem destroy value before. At <a href="http://memmo.me">memmo.me</a>, our entire business depended on celebrities creating content. One celebrity deciding to stop could hurt our platform. At Spotify, I watched Taylor Swift pull her entire catalog to go exclusive elsewhere. Not business-ending, but a clear reminder of who held the real power at the time.</p>
<p>Both situations taught me the same lesson: when your business model depends on someone else’s decisions, you’re never fully in control.</p>
<p>Most third-party AI platforms face this exact squeeze today. Every improvement costs more tokens. Every feature burns more cash. When you’re optimizing for token efficiency instead of user experience, you’ve already lost the game.</p>
<p>Lovable just escaped that trap.</p>
<p>They raised $200M and launched infrastructure features like hosting, security, and team collaboration. Where their previous improvements often depended on more intricate ways of prompting and cost more and more tokens, now they’re creating revenue streams that don’t burn API tokens.</p>
<p>This isn’t just about adding features. It’s about changing what business they’re in.</p>
<p>They’re not competing with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google on pure generation anymore. They’re becoming the place where AI-generated apps live. That’s the infrastructure move that changes everything.</p>
<p>Now when you build something with Lovable that uses their new offerings, moving it elsewhere means migrating your database, your custom domain, your team workspace. Possible, but painful.</p>
<p>The pattern repeats across industries. Record stores couldn’t compete when big box retailers sold CDs as loss leaders. Travel agencies disappeared when airlines cut commissions. Cable companies survived by becoming ISPs instead of fighting Netflix for content.</p>
<p>Stop being the middleman. Start owning the infrastructure.</p>
<p>Every successful platform eventually faces this choice. You either own something irreplaceable or you become a feature that someone else can build cheaper.</p>
<p>When costs rise and margins shrink, you either control something customers can’t easily leave, or you watch your business model collapse one price increase at a time.</p>
<p>Lovable chose ownership.</p>
<p>Other AI platforms will need to make similar moves soon. Own the deployment pipeline. Control the data layer. Become infrastructure that’s harder to replace than the generation itself.</p>
<p>The intermediary becomes the infrastructure, or the intermediary dies.</p>
<p>That’s the choice.</p>

                    <description>Here’s what I’ve noticed: when I share a personal story or genuine viewpoint, people don’t care if AI helped me write it. The authenticity of the experience matters more than the authenticity of the prose. You can’t fake living through something. You can get help explaining what you lived through. There’s a difference between using AI to find better words for your thoughts and using AI to have thoughts for you. The story has to be yours. The telling can be collaborative.</description>

<p>AI wants to write everything. Long paragraphs. Perfect transitions. Neat conclusions that wrap everything up with a bow.</p>
<p>I spend most of my time cutting. Removing words I don’t like. Cleaning up endings that over-explain the point.</p>
<p>The creative work has shifted. It’s not about generating anymore, it’s about recognizing what matters and ruthlessly eliminating what doesn’t.</p>
<p>I’m forced to practice saying “no” to perfectly decent sentences because they’re not essential.</p>
<p>I’m learning how to distill without losing the core.</p>
<p>How to be brief without being empty.</p>

<p>Senior developers know better. Small commits. Testable changes. Break it down further.</p>
<p>As a CTO, I coach the same thing. What’s the smallest thing we can release? Can we make a PoC first? How do we break this down?</p>
<p>Now I’m watching people learn this same lesson with AI.</p>
<p>AI wants to write your entire blog post, refactor your whole function, solve your complete problem. Just like junior me, it feels productive.</p>
<p>It isn’t.</p>
<p>The people who get the most out of AI are treating it like code. Small changes they can verify. Iterative improvements they can stand behind.</p>
<p>They’re learning in months what took me years: the more powerful your tool, the more restraint you need to use it well.</p>
<p>Turns out incremental thinking isn’t just good engineering. It’s good everything.</p>

                    <description>Creation loses to consumption because we make it harder than it needs to be. Want to start writing? We think about starting a blog, choosing a platform, designing a theme. Too much friction. Want to learn to code? We plan out an entire app, research frameworks, set up development environments. Too many steps. Want to draw? We think about technique, style, the right tools. Too much pressure. Meanwhile, consumption is always one click away. The path of least resistance wins every time.

<p>Want to start writing? We think about starting a blog, choosing a platform, designing a theme. Too much friction.</p>
<p>Want to learn to code? We plan out an entire app, research frameworks, set up development environments. Too many steps.</p>
<p>Want to draw? We think about technique, style, the right tools. Too much pressure.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, consumption is always one click away.</p>
<p>The path of least resistance wins every time.</p>
<p>So make creation the easier path: open a text file and write one paragraph. Write a function that adds two numbers. Draw something, anything, on paper.</p>
<p>Lower the barrier until creation becomes the default choice.</p>

Cooking, family time, basic life maintenance fills most of the rest. What you’re really optimizing for is maybe 2 hours of discretionary time. Maybe an hour in the morning before things get hectic. Maybe an hour in the evening after everything settles down. The consumption vs creation debate isn’t about revolutionizing your whole life. It’s about what you do with...</description>

<p>Work takes 8 hours. Sleep takes 8 more. Cooking, family time, basic life maintenance fills most of the rest.</p>
<p>What you’re really optimizing for is maybe 2 hours of discretionary time.</p>
<p>Maybe an hour in the morning before things get hectic. Maybe an hour in the evening after everything settles down.</p>
<p>The consumption vs creation debate isn’t about revolutionizing your whole life. It’s about what you do with those precious few windows.</p>
<p>That’s when you’re actually choosing: do I scroll or do I write? Do I watch or do I build?</p>
<p>Forget the grand life overhaul. Just win those 2 hours.</p>

                    <description>Getting back to creating after completing something has always been complicated for me. It’s like the weight of the completed, iterated, polished version becomes the goal post for the next creative thing. The next thing needs to start on the same level as the previous was when it was completed. This happens almost every time I try to create again. I overconsume on data, reports, articles and research to make a “better” next project. But really, I’m just avoiding starting at the messy beginning...</description>

<p>The solution isn’t better research. It’s permission to suck again.</p>
<p>Your first draft doesn’t need to compete with your last published piece. It just needs to exist.</p>

                    <title>The Long-Term Trap</title>

                    <description>We’ve trained ourselves to think long-term about everything. “But what if this needs to scale to millions of users?” “How will this architecture handle enterprise requirements?” “What happens when the team grows to 50 developers?” All reasonable questions.

<p>“But what if this needs to scale to millions of users?”</p>
<p>“How will this architecture handle enterprise requirements?”</p>
<p>“What happens when the team grows to 50 developers?”</p>
<p>All reasonable questions. For the wrong projects.</p>
<p>I’ve watched teams spend years discussing between Symfony vs Laravel and then the problem disappeared in two weeks when company moved to java as the golden path. They were so focused on building the “right” foundation that they missed the shifting ground beneath them.</p>
<p>When you’re building a prototype to test an idea, enterprise-grade infrastructure is like bringing a crane to hang a picture frame.</p>
<p>The bias toward long-term thinking creates an invisible tax on every decision. Database schemas become more complex than needed. Code gets abstracted for flexibility that never comes. Simple features become architectural discussions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, competitors ship working versions and learn what actually matters.</p>
<p>The irony? By the time you’ve built something robust enough to “scale properly,” the market has often moved on. Your bulletproof solution solves yesterday’s problem with tomorrow’s complexity.</p>
<p>I’m not advocating for sloppy work. I’m questioning our default assumption that every project needs to survive nuclear war.</p>
<p>Sometimes the best long-term strategy is admitting you don’t know what the long term looks like.</p>
<p>Build for what you know today. Let tomorrow teach you what it actually needs.</p>

<p>“It’s changing everything!” say the enthusiasts.</p>
<p>“It’s destroying software quality!” counter the traditionalists.</p>
<p>Both camps are missing something fundamental: vibe coding has existed for five months.</p>
<p>Five. Months.</p>
<p>That’s not enough time to change a coffee order habit, let alone organizational foundations. Yet here we are, debating whether it’s revolutionizing or ruining enterprise development.</p>
<p>I’ve watched companies spend longer than five months just deciding which project management tool to use. The idea that a coding approach could fundamentally reshape organizational values in the same timeframe is… well… optimistic.</p>
<p>Real organizational change operates on geological timescales. Culture shifts happen when people retire, not when new tools emerge. The companies celebrating vibe coding victories today are probably the same ones who adopted React faster than everyone else because they were already comfortable with experimentation.</p>
<p>The companies dismissing it as dangerous chaos? They were already risk-averse.</p>
<p>Vibe coding didn’t change these organizations. It reveals them.</p>
<p>Maybe the question isn’t whether vibe coding will transform how we work. Maybe it’s whether we’re ready to see what our organizations actually value when a faster option appears.</p>
<p>Five months is just enough time to show what was already there.</p>

The satisfying click of the scroll wheel. You can’t experience lag in a prototype. You can’t feel the awkward pause between tapping a button and seeing a response. Screenshots are beautiful liars.

<p>Weight. Texture. The satisfying click of the scroll wheel.</p>
<p>You can’t experience lag in a prototype. You can’t feel the awkward pause between tapping a button and seeing a response. Screenshots are beautiful liars.</p>
<p>We’ve gotten so good at making static designs look finished that we’ve forgotten they’re just educated guesses.</p>
<p>A perfectly polished Figma prototype sends the wrong signal: “This is ready. Don’t change it.” The more professional it looks, the more people hesitate to suggest improvements. Nobody wants to be the person asking for “small tweaks” to something that looks complete.</p>
<p>But show someone a working prototype where they can type in a text field and watch their words appear instantly? Different story.</p>
<p>“Can this button be bigger?”</p>
<p>“What if the text was clearer?”</p>
<p>“This feels slow - can we make it faster?”</p>
<p>Suddenly everyone becomes a user experience expert. Not because they know more, but because they’re experiencing rather than imagining.</p>
<p>The best feedback comes from touching, not looking.</p>
<p>Paper sketches invite edits because they look unfinished. Working prototypes invite interaction because they feel real. Polished mockups invite approval because they seem done.</p>
<p>Choose your invitation wisely.</p>

<p>“Most people who stop here prefer memoirs over how-to books”</p>
<p>“You made it 60% through, here’s something that builds on those concepts”</p>

<p>Messy doesn’t even begin to describe it. At least once a year, someone would try to kill it. And fail.</p>
<p>On paper? Simple. It picked which market and language a user lived in. Geographic data plus browser settings, with some fallbacks thrown in. Easy, right?</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>The code was so woven into our system that touching it meant rewriting everything. We kept thinking “IT JUST PICKS MARKET AND LANGUAGE!!!1?” But that abstraction blinded us to the real complexity.</p>
<p>I see the same pattern now with AI-assisted coding.</p>
<p>You dip your toes in. You think everything’s simple. “Just build me an app that does X.” But you’re the complexity. You understand the full flow. You abstract away all the messy details that make starting from scratch so hard.</p>
<p>This is where Gall’s law hits you: “Complex systems that work have invariably evolved from simpler systems that worked.”</p>
<p>Start smaller. Start easier.</p>
<p>Don’t go all-in on “Create an app where everyone can chat with everyone in the world and it should be encrypted.”</p>
<p>Start with two people. Make that work first.</p>

<p>For years companies tried to copy the Spotify Model. Squads, tribes, chapters, guilds. The whole thing.</p>
<p>Just to realize that Spotify wasn’t even using it anymore.</p>
<p>It was a utopian vision of how work could happen at a specific moment in Spotify’s life. Not a universal framework.</p>
<p>By the time a system becomes famous enough to copy, it’s already been abandoned by the people who created it.</p>
<p>So when we look at how others do things, we need to understand their input. Their constraints. Their actual daily reality.</p>
<p>Not just the polished model they present at conferences.</p>
<p>Copy the thinking, not the system.</p>

                    <description>A few months ago I bought a close to broken old record player and speakers for $25. Since then I’ve bought used and reissues of old classics on vinyl. There is something special to the feeling of dropping the needle on the LP’s first track and listening through to the end, not skipping a song because I don’t like it, but keeping at it because it’s what the artist aimed at. Delivering a story. I’d never heard David Bowie’s Heroes album before this, just the hits. But those wonky odd tracks in...</description>

<p>I’d never heard David Bowie’s Heroes album before this, just the hits. But those wonky odd tracks in between? They’re what make the whole story work.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be interesting if artists themselves could say: you cannot listen to any specific tune until you’ve listened to this complete album.</p>
<p>Think of the kind of stories that would then be able to be told again. </p>
<p>Like going to the Louvre and only seeing the Mona Lisa before leaving. You miss all the context that makes it truly special.</p>

<p>I keep seeing memes about “AI Agents everywhere!” and people dismissing them as the next metaverse fad or NFT bubble. But I think they’re missing something important.</p>
<p>Look at the behavioral shift happening. Most people I know now go to ChatGPT instead of Google when they need answers, help figuring out strategic decisions or polish their slides.</p>
<p>We’re not just changing how we find information. We’re changing how we interact with services entirely. Instead of building our own AI agents, the smart move might be building for the AI agents people already use.</p>
<p>Then there’s the money. Big tech is pouring billions into AI infrastructure and development. This collective industry pivot is massive. The only comparable shift I can think of is when everything moved to “the cloud”.</p>
<p>The memes about AI agents being everywhere aren’t wrong. They’re just missing the point about what that actually means for how we’ll do business.</p>

                    <description>Most technical leaders didn’t become leaders to lead. They became leaders because that’s where the influence was. The budget decisions. The architectural choices.

<p>They became leaders because that’s where the influence was. The budget decisions. The architectural choices. The strategic direction.</p>
<p>But somewhere along the way, they stopped building things.</p>
<p>Meetings replaced coding sessions. Presentation replaced prototypes. They found themselves describing solutions instead of creating them.</p>
<p>AI development tools might change that equation entirely.</p>
<p>What if you could maintain strategic oversight while personally building the critical pieces? What if leading didn’t mean delegating everything?</p>
<p>The traditional model assumed you couldn’t do both. Leadership required full attention. Technical work required deep focus. Pick one.</p>
<p>But AI tools compress the time between idea and implementation. That strategy you’ve been explaining in slide decks? You could prototype it this afternoon.</p>
<p>The architectural vision you’ve been communicating through diagrams? You could build the foundational pieces yourself.</p>
<p>This isn’t about micromanaging or stepping on your team’s toes. It’s about leaders who understand systems deeply enough to know which problems to solve personally.</p>
<p>The CEO who builds the core algorithm. The CTO who prototypes the new platform architecture. The VP who writes the critical integration herself.</p>
<p>Not because the team can’t do it. Because they can do it better, faster, and with more context about where it fits in the bigger picture.</p>
<p>These leaders aren’t telling their teams what to build. They’re building alongside them. Sharing knowledge in real-time. Showing techniques and explaining trade-offs as they happen. It’s leadership through example rather than directive.</p>
<p>We might see a new type of leader emerging. The hands-on executive who combines strategic thinking with personal execution. Someone who doesn’t just direct the work but actively participates in creating it.</p>
<p>The best leaders were usually great individual contributors first.</p>
<p>Maybe AI tools will let them be both again.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Baby boomers occupied knowledge work positions longer than any generation before them. Unlike factory workers who retired from physical labor, knowledge workers just stayed. Programming doesn’t wear out your knees.</p>
<p>Now the last boomers are stepping down. Someone has to fill those positions.</p>
<p>That someone is probably in their late thirties. Two decades of experience. You’ve seen frameworks come and go. You remember when JavaScript was a toy language.</p>
<p>But you might not need to follow the traditional path.</p>
<p>The old model was predictable. Get experience. Move to management. Trade your keyboard for spreadsheets and slides.</p>
<p>AI development tools will change that equation.</p>
<p>Why manage a team of five junior developers when you can have the productivity of fifteen?</p>
<p>You know what good code looks like. You understand system architecture. You’ve debugged enough production fires to spot problems before they happen. Now you have tools that amplify that experience instead of bureaucratizing it.</p>
<p>Junior developers will learn AI-assisted coding as their baseline. But they lack the pattern recognition that comes from years of mistakes. They don’t know which shortcuts lead to technical debt disasters.</p>
<p>You do.</p>
<p>Combined with AI tools, that experience becomes a superpower. This creates a new archetype: the experienced individual contributor who skips management entirely and becomes a one-person product factory.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing though: they might not be in a hurry to leave either. Why retire when you can outproduce entire teams? Why step aside when you’re finally having fun building again?</p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>Meet the new boomers.</p>

                    <link>https://mattias.blog/maybe-it-doesnt-need-to-scale</link>
                    <description>LinkedIn is full of developers dunking on “vibe coding.” “It doesn’t scale,” they say. “You can’t build enterprise systems this way.” “What happens when your team grows?” They’re probably right.

                            <![CDATA[<p>LinkedIn is full of developers dunking on “vibe coding.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t scale,” they say. “You can’t build enterprise systems this way.” “What happens when your team grows?”</p>
<p>They’re probably right.</p>
<p>And maybe that’s completely missing the point.</p>
<p>Scale is the wrong metric for personal productivity. It’s like judging a custom-tailored suit by whether it fits everyone in the company.</p>
<p>With AI development tools like Claude Code, personal optimization becomes effortless.</p>
<p>I no longer spend hours reading documentation just to remember how to set up a basic Express server. I don’t wade through boilerplate code to get started. I don’t compromise my vision because the existing tools almost-but-not-quite fit my needs.</p>
<p>I describe what I want. I get exactly what I want.</p>
<p>This isn’t about building Facebook. It’s about solving my problems, the way I think about them, with tools that bend to my mental model instead of forcing me to bend to theirs.</p>
<p>Team coordination? Code reviews? Maintainability? These remain important for large systems. But they’re separate problems from personal effectiveness.</p>
<p>The real challenge isn’t accommodating more developers. It’s amplifying the ones you have.</p>
<p>When I can generate a perfect Obsidian plugin in the time it takes to take a shower, the old rules about scalable development practices feel… quaint.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s about teams that scale through individual superpowers. The best engineering organizations won’t be the biggest. They’ll be small teams where everyone operates at peak personal effectiveness while still collaborating seamlessly.</p>
<p>That’s a different kind of scale entirely.</p>

                    <description>A few days ago, I realized I’d been posting on my blog every day for six months. My initial plan? One month. But momentum carried me forward, even through a four-day hospital stay. The blog lives on Cloudflare, but today I hit a snag. My posts weren’t stored with my other notes. I couldn’t cross-reference them in my notes tool. My old approach would have been predictable: hunt for a tool that takes my RSS feed, creates a local version, and downloads referenced images. Maybe spend hours...</description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A few days ago, I realized I’d been posting on my blog every day for six months.</p>
<p>My initial plan? One month. But momentum carried me forward, even through a four-day hospital stay.</p>
<p>The blog lives on Cloudflare, but today I hit a snag. My posts weren’t stored with my other notes. I couldn’t cross-reference them in my notes tool.</p>
<p>My old approach would have been predictable: hunt for a tool that takes my RSS feed, creates a local version, and downloads referenced images. Maybe spend hours researching options. Maybe settle for something that almost works.</p>
<p>AI development tools changed this habit for me.</p>
<p>I opened my terminal. Created a folder. Fired up Claude Code with the somewhat scary <code>claude --dangerously-skip-permissions</code> and wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I have a blog with an RSS feed. I want to write a plugin for Obsidian where it downloads all posts and images, converts them to the correct format, and adds them to a specific folder.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I went to brew coffee.</p>
<p>When I came back? A working plugin. Exactly what I wanted.</p>
<p>This is the Tony Stark and Jarvis feeling. I bring the ideas. The LLM handles execution. I test and confirm.</p>
<p>No wrestling with documentation. No Stack Overflow rabbit holes. No compromising on requirements because the existing tools don’t quite fit.</p>
<p>Just problem to solution in the time it takes coffee to brew.</p>
<p>Does it scale? No, not right now.</p>
<p>Does it need to scale? I don’t know.</p>
<p>Maybe scale isn’t about building massive systems anymore. Maybe it’s about having near-unlimited capability to solve your specific problems perfectly.</p>
<p>Like having a personal manufacturing line for software tools.</p>
<p>Each solution fits exactly because it’s built exactly for you.</p>
<p>p.s. you can download the <a href="https://github.com/ahlstrominfo/rss-blog-importer">plugin for Obsidian over at github</a>.</p>

                    <description>Creativity comes from boredom. Real boredom. The kind where you stare at nothing for half an hour and let your mind wander. When you fill every moment with distractions, you get lazy creativity. You pick the first thing that comes to mind. That’s the path of least resistance. Real creativity needs mental free time. Space to break habits and explore different perspectives. But we’ve eliminated boredom entirely. You have access to almost all music ever recorded. Every movie you could want....</description>

<p>Real boredom. The kind where you stare at nothing for half an hour and let your mind wander.</p>
<p>When you fill every moment with distractions, you get lazy creativity. You pick the first thing that comes to mind. That’s the path of least resistance.</p>
<p>Real creativity needs mental free time. Space to break habits and explore different perspectives.</p>
<p>But we’ve eliminated boredom entirely.</p>
<p>You have access to almost all music ever recorded. Every movie you could want. Infinite YouTube videos. Chat tools that answer any question instantly.</p>
<p>And we use it all.</p>
<p>We’re always distracted from boredom.</p>
<p>Too distracted to get creative.</p>
<p>Make sure to leave some room for boredom. The kind where you sit and suddenly find yourself daydreaming.</p>

                    <description>We’ve adapted behaviours that interrupt us constantly, then we wonder why we can’t focus deeply. Every app fights for our attention. We cram every hour with meetings. We want to be productive, but we have designed much of our day to day with pings, dings and rings. These are the systems we live in now, and identifying them is only the first step.</description>

                    <description>With all the outrage about AI writing and coding not being “real creativity”, I can’t stop thinking about when sampling became a thing in the 80s. Musicians taking bits and pieces from other records to create something new. It was legally messy but creatively fascinating. Is this what we’re experiencing now? AI will follow sampling’s playbook: outrage, adoption, amnesia. Today’s “AI kills creativity” will be tomorrow’s “I’ve always used these tools.”</description>

<p>The result is predictably frustrating. While others focus on shipping products, these teams struggle to even update their website with new features because their custom CMS has become a maintenance burden that multiple developers have touched over time.</p>
<p>It’s one of those situations where professional pride works against business outcomes.</p>

When everyone else focuses on making it easier for ChatGPT to index all their content and hope that it picks theirs.

                            <![CDATA[<p>I’ve watched several companies try the same clever approach: build a product while running a consultancy. Use downtime to work on the product. Makes sense, right?</p>
<p>The logic is simple. When developers aren’t busy with client work, they focus on building something that could eventually become the main business. Sounds like smart resource utilization.</p>
<p>But here’s where it gets interesting.</p>
<p>The challenge always became prioritization. How do you decide what these “spare time” developers should work on? You can’t give them the most critical features because what if a client project comes up and pulls them away?</p>
<p>So you end up giving them the less important stuff. The nice to have features. The experimental work. Tasks without real deadlines or with artificial ones just to create some focus.</p>
<p>That sounds reasonable. Low risk, low commitment work for uncertain availability.</p>
<p>But then you hit the handoff problem.</p>
<p>Eventually, this side work needs to integrate with the main product. The core team (the one working on actual priorities) has to stop what they’re doing to review, understand and approve the work from the “spare time” team.</p>
<p>That’s when things get messy.</p>
<p>You end up with a priority inversion. Your high-priority work gets deprioritized so you can process the low-priority work you assigned to fill downtime.</p>
<p>The thing you said was most important gets pushed aside to handle the thing you said was least important.</p>
<p>I’ve seen this pattern multiple times now. It always looks smart on paper. Use every available hour. Keep people productive. Build toward the future.</p>
<p>But coordination isn’t free. Context switching isn’t free. Code review isn’t free.</p>
<p>The overhead of managing “spare time” work often costs more than the value it creates. You’re not just losing the output, you’re actively making your core work less efficient.</p>
<p>It’s one of those management ideas that optimizes for the wrong thing. Instead of optimizing for maximum utilization, you should optimize for maximum progress on what actually matters.</p>
<p>There are plenty of valuable things to do with spare time. Code reviews, documentation, experimenting with existing features, learning new skills, hanging out with the support team. The list goes on.</p>
<p>Just don’t pretend you can build your core product features in the margins.</p>

<p>But here’s what I find interesting about that number.</p>
<p>Most major technologies follow this adoption curve: 2-3 years of experimentation and learning followed by gradual scaling and measurable returns in years 3-7.</p>
<p>GenAI is actually moving faster than typical but the timeline for measurable enterprise-wide returns appears totally consistent with other major technology shifts.</p>
<p>The 80% figure isn’t a GenAI problem. It’s the normal pattern for transformative technologies.</p>
<p><strong>We’ve seen this before.</strong></p>
<p>ERP systems took 2-5 years to show significant ROI. Cloud computing took years before most companies saw meaningful returns.</p>
<p>GenAI has been widely available for just 2 years.</p>
<p>If you’re struggling to show enterprise-wide returns from AI right now, you’re not behind schedule.</p>
<p>You’re right on time.</p>

<p>Today I fired up Claude Code and added an MCP to my blog.</p>
<p>For the non-technical folks: I basically gave Claude direct access to all my writing. It can now read through everything I’ve written, search for patterns, find connections I missed.</p>
<p>The tool gave me something I didn’t expect, a sort of curiosity about my own work.</p>
<p>I used to Google my own site to find a specific post I remembered. Now I can ask “What was I thinking about in March that I didn’t fully explore?” or “Show me where I keep iterating on the same idea but in different ways.”</p>
<p>It’s like the difference between having a messy room and well… having a messy room with a really good search function. Same stuff, completely different relationship to what’s there.</p>
<p>Now I have a way to be genuinely curious about what I’ve created. To ask it questions. To explore it like someone else’s work.</p>

<p>Students who started with AI first? Their brains basically went to sleep. But students who thought through ideas themselves THEN used ChatGPT? Their neural networks lit up stronger than ever.</p>
<p>This reminded me of that kid from school group projects. Whenever we had a group assignment he just hung around. Not really invested in discussions or well… interested at all. He performed poorly at the tests and presentations.</p>
<p>The study found AI-first students couldn’t even remember sentences they’d just written. But the think-first-then-collaborate kids? Strongest brain activity of all.</p>
<p>Working with AI is like a group assignment and this kid struggled with it. The study somewhat proved that we need different support. Similar to how that kid needed support.</p>

<p>That’s exactly how I approach AI in writing.</p>
<p>I used to struggle getting my thoughts down clearly. My ideas would get muddled somewhere between my brain and the page. AI became my thinking partner. Someone to bounce ideas off of and help me get my thoughts crisp and tight.</p>
<p>But here’s the crucial distinction: I still want my ideas and stories to shine. Not fabricated ones. What’s truly unique is my viewpoint and experience. Not my writing craft.</p>
<p>I found my voice not despite using AI, but partly because of it. The tool helped me see patterns in my thinking. Pushed me to be clearer. Gave me confidence to share ideas I might have kept to myself.</p>
<p>The fear is that AI will make us all sound the same. That only happens if you treat it like a vending machine. Generic prompts get generic content. Use it as a thinking partner and you get something else entirely.</p>
<p>Your voice isn’t just how you write. It’s what you choose to write about. How you think about problems.</p>

<p>We’ve been moving toward ‘Google Zero’ for years, where people get their answers directly from search results without ever clicking through to websites. Featured snippets, knowledge panels, instant answers. AI overviews are just the logical next step in this progression.</p>
<p>Are we seeing a return to the early web’s “answers upfront” approach? I’m thinking Yahoo’s curated portals, but with AI doing the curation automatically.</p>
<p>For the longest time we used “google us” as a verification that we were legit, and taught our users that that was the way to go. The problem was that the model got corrupted on the way. SEO spam and sponsored results meant you weren’t exploring authentic sources anymore.</p>
<p>AI overviews aren’t just about creators losing traffic. They’re a correction to a discovery system that had already broken.</p>
<p>Brand awareness becomes even more important. People need to know how to come to your site directly when they want your specific view of the story, not just the AI’s summary.</p>

<p>Those decisions to constrain, to say no, to leave things out. They’re often what separates good work from great work.</p>
<p>AI can generate endless possibilities, but it can’t feel the weight of choosing restraint.</p>

<p>The more I think about it, em dashes are the Sharknado of writing.</p>
<p>What 30 years ago would have been a crazy feat now feels like obvious special effects.</p>
<p>You know that moment in a movie when the CGI gets so obvious it breaks your immersion? That’s what’s happening with em dashes in 2025. We’ve developed “AI blindness” where our brains filter out patterns that feel artificial.</p>
<p>The real issue isn’t the punctuation itself. It’s the moment readers start questioning authenticity instead of engaging with ideas.</p>
<p><strong>We’re creating an “authenticity uncanny valley.”</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile professional writers have been loving em dashes since long before ChatGPT existed. But now they’re second-guessing themselves, worried their natural style might trigger someone’s AI detector.</p>
<p>The same technique goes from impressive to eye-roll-inducing purely based on audience expectations, not because the thing itself has changed.</p>
<p>The feedback loop is absurd: the more people avoid certain patterns to seem “authentic,” the more those patterns become markers of inauthenticity.</p>
<p>Welcome to 2025, where even punctuation has an uncanny valley.</p>

<p>In <em>Back to the Future Part II</em>, Marty McFly walks into Cafe 80’s in 2015 and plays an old arcade game. He’s pretty good at it. But when he finishes, a couple of kids watching him are baffled: “You mean you have to use your <em>hands</em>? That’s like a baby’s toy!”</p>
<hr>
<p>Something big has changed in how we find information. Before, we searched Google, clicked through a bunch of links, and pieced everything together ourselves. Now we just ask a question and get an answer we can improve through conversation.</p>
<p>AI that can search isn’t just another tool. It’s a completely different way of working with information.</p>
<p><strong>The Old Way: Search and Put It Together</strong></p>
<p>This was the Google era. You got good at turning your questions into search terms, quickly scanning results, and opening way too many browser tabs. If you were really organized, you saved links for later.</p>
<p>Then you did the hard work of reading through different websites, figuring out what was useful, and putting it all together in your head to get your answer.</p>
<p>You learned to spot good sources. Not just the facts, but you could tell when a website was sketchy because it had more ads than actual content. You got better at seeing patterns across different articles.</p>
<p><strong>The New Way: Ask and Check</strong></p>
<p>Now that we’re in the conversation era, your main skill is asking good questions. Instead of hunting through search results and trying to avoid all the sponsored links at the top, you’re talking to an AI that can instantly pull together information from the entire internet, your own files, and your company’s data.</p>
<p>Your brain does completely different work now. Instead of collecting puzzle pieces, you’re checking whether the completed puzzle looks right. You need to quickly figure out if an answer is complete, correct, and actually helpful for what you need.</p>
<p>The question isn’t whether you’ll make this switch. It’s how quickly you’ll realize that how you work with information has changed forever.</p>

                    <description>Some say we are moving from information scarcity to information abundance. My view is that this transition has already happened.

<p>We’re moving from “search and synthesize” to “ask and evaluate.”</p>
<p>The true bottleneck now is the quality of your questions and your ability to recognize what is good. </p>

<p>Suddenly we were on endless digital whiteboards trying to replicate physical spaces - the act of seeing multiple post-its on a wall, grabbing them and placing them somewhere else. And when the tools worked smoothly we got a sensation of watching others peoples cursors move and filter, sort and group it felt promising.</p>
<p>But since those years we have eagerly trying to return to our previous ways of working. Back in the rooms, not on screens.</p>
<p>Had we truly adapted one way of working to the digital medium, we might have had an additional tool and expanded our toolset.</p>
<p>The messy part of physical boards is the thing we have a hard time replicating. The badly handwritten notes that someone needed to explain for us to understand. The oddly sorted board that sparked new ideas since it was not just catagoriesed in the optimal AI way.</p>
<p>Maybe it is this imperfect human approach that the digital tools lack for us to make unexpected connections and innovation.</p>

                    <description>Instead focus on creating material that people actually interact with. “Old” social media worked like mailing lists. More followers meant more people saw your posts. “New” social media is all about engagement. An account with 10 followers can go viral with the right piece. The algorithm favours interaction over audience size. Good engaging work will find its people. What counts as “good” is another story.</description>

<p>Think of your house. We all have walls, floors, kitchens and bathrooms. Pipes run a certain way and electrical wiring another. These follow standards for good reason.</p>
<p>It’s what goes in front of these foundations that makes a home unique and helps it stand out.</p>
<p>If we needed to explain basic construction principles to every carpenter or electrician who steps through our door, we’d waste valuable time.</p>
<p>Which parts of your work truly need your unique touch, and which could follow patterns that AI already understands?</p>

<p>Business people are focused on solving their current problems, while programmers are considering edge cases, future requirements, and technical challenges that aren’t obvious from the surface.</p>
<p>We could improve at communicating why this matters. The key is helping business see the value in our questions i.e. explaining how today’s overlooked edge case becomes tomorrow’s production outage or performance bottleneck.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>After nearly 30 years developing software from startups to established companies, I’ve watched the same story play out repeatedly.</p>
<p>A young company gets some funding. Developers arrive eager to build something amazing. Then someone utters those fatal words: “We need to build for scalability.”</p>
<p>This is where bias and intuition clash in dangerous ways.</p>
<p>The intuition of experienced builders says focus on getting the product right first. Make something people want before worrying about serving millions. Get the plane in the air before optimising its fuel efficiency at 30000 feet.</p>
<p>The bias comes from pattern matching successful companies. “Amazon uses micro services so we should too.” “Netflix has a complex deployment pipeline so that must be the right approach.”</p>
<p>I witnessed this firsthand at a startup where engineers pushed to move from App Engine to Cloud Run for “reliability reasons.” We spent precious runway time refactoring infrastructure instead of improving the product people were paying for. Leadership didn’t understand the tradeoffs. The company eventually went bankrupt.</p>
<p>The inexperienced self-proclaimed senior developers kept insisting “This isn’t how you build for scalability.” But scalability wasn’t our problem. Finding product market fit was.</p>
<p>Scale is a question of <strong>when</strong> not <strong>if</strong>. The wisdom comes in recognising the right time to focus on it and be clear about this with both leadership and developers.</p>
<p>And never f*** up payments.</p>

                    <description>Rubber ducking, the exercise of explaining something to a rubber duck, is an easy way to get out of your own head and gain clarity by explaining your thoughts out loud. Another excellent technique is called question burst. You explain your problem in 2 minutes and then others ask questions for 4 minutes. Question bursts force you to create a high-level explanation quickly and then benefit from external perspectives through thoughtful questions.</description>

                    <link>https://mattias.blog/finding-this-small-triggers-that-changes-habits</link>
                    <description>When you want to change habits you need to identify the triggers. These are the seemingly small things that determine whether you take a run before breakfast or hit breakfast first. I’m not a training junkie by any measure, but I know that if I want to exercise in the morning I need to put out my clothes the night before. That small trigger change is all that is needed. If you don’t know the triggers, you will not change the habits.</description>

                    <link>https://mattias.blog/choose-x-0-upgrades-not-0-x-improvements</link>
                    <description>When acquiring new things focus on what makes your life an x.0 upgrade rather than just a 0.x improvement. Upgrading from mobile phone version 14 to 15 might not make sense if the benefits are minuscule. Remember that “1.0” is just branding. Look beyond the marketing to determine if something truly represents a significant upgrade for your specific needs.</description>

                    <description>There are two common paths to building products that matter. One: create a copy of existing products then add your standout features. The other: focus solely on your core vision of what makes you unique. One takes time. The other needs courage. Think of the first iPhone. It was revolutionary, yet lacked many features that already existed in the market.</description>

                    <description>When customers buy your products they aim for three things beyond function: social status, positive emotions or saving money. If you build products focused on status or emotions you’re golden. Focus on saving money and you’re in a race to the bottom. Your product isn’t just features. It’s what those features deliver.</description>

                    <description>I’ve been running Design Sprints for years since the method was first introduced as a book. One practice that really stuck with me is “Always Be Capturing”. The concept is simple: as the facilitator, you capture ideas on post-its or whiteboards the moment people share them. This small practice has some great side-effects. It saves the in-the-moment discussions and thoughts, shows the participants their ideas are important, it creates a visual summary that we can use as a “was this what you...</description>

<p>One practice that really stuck with me is “Always Be Capturing”.</p>
<p>The concept is simple: as the facilitator, you capture ideas on post-its or whiteboards the moment people share them. This small practice has some great side-effects. It saves the in-the-moment discussions and thoughts, shows the participants their ideas are important, it creates a visual summary that we can use as a “was this what you meant?” and probably the best part is that it creates a collection of ideas that we can organise later.</p>
<p>I use this during conversations, while listening to audiobooks, or podcasts. I’ve set up a quick shortcut on my phone that opens a text area and saves notes directly to my favorite note-taking app.</p>
<p>The beauty of this system is its simplicity. Capture first, then group, filter, and remix later.</p>

                    <description>The cost of entry for AI is lower now than it will ever be again. If we only use AI for quick answers we’ll struggle to justify higher costs in the future. Those who use AI as a thinking partner will see the value differently. They’ll happily pay increased prices because they’ve experienced AI as an affordable teammate rather than just a fancy search engine.</description>

                    <description>Every piece of text you write adds weight to the story you tell. At some point that weight makes the story complicated and hard to understand. Weight becomes the blocker for advancing. You have built debt. This applies to generating code with AI too. It’s powerful but can produce code in wrong places, fix unintended problems and make assumptions about what to write. Just because AI can create a lot quickly doesn’t mean it’s creating what we need.</description>

<p>At some point the industry decided fullstack was the ideal. You should handle everything from pixel-perfect CSS to database optimization because… it’s efficient? More cost-effective?</p>
<p>Outside of solo entrepreneurs I’ve met remarkably few developers who genuinely enjoy both ends of the spectrum equally. Most have clear preferences. They either light up discussing UI interactions or get excited about backend architecture but rarely both.</p>
<p>This preference gap can explain why tools like vibe coding are gaining popularity. These tools reduce the parts of development work people enjoy least while still getting the job done.</p>

                    <description>I’ve found AI actually demands a different kind of thinking from me. When I’m vague, it gives vague results. This forces me to clarify my own thinking and be more precise. The cognitive work doesn’t disappear, it shifts to higher level of design and critical evaluation. The challenge is using AI intentionally rather than letting it replace our thinking entirely.</description>

<p>Sure there’ll be links, but think of them more as page 2 of Google results. People that want answers want them quick and GenAI delivers right now.</p>
<p>How this will disrupt the ads business, a business where number of eyes is important we don’t know yet. But just think about the effect it has when an AI Assistant searches on your behalf and give you the results you need.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Throughout my development career I’ve probably been acting like a code chameleon. Join a company, look at PRs and code and try to mirror the style and ask the subtle question of “Which code and PRs should I mimic if I want my submissions to pass quickly?”</p>
<p>This adaptive behavior isn’t just about following rules. It’s about understanding the unwritten language of this new codebase. That teams develop patterns and practices that represent their knowledge.</p>
<p>Current AI coding tools miss this context. They generate functional but generic code drawn from open source repositories, that in isolation are awesome but in relation to existing internal codebases are off. </p>
<p>They write average code for specific environments that don’t want to be average.</p>
<h2>Beyond Simple Generation</h2>
<p>I believe we’re heading toward a more sophisticated approach with specialized AI agents handling different aspects of development.</p>
<p><strong>Solution Agents</strong> that focuses purely on solving the problem, functionally without concern for style or conventions. <strong>Adaptation Agent</strong> that transform this solution to match the companies specific patterns and practices and possibly a <strong>Readability Agent</strong> that ensures that this code is comprehensible by humans.</p>
<p>First write the expectations, then generate the code, then create tests, then refine the code. Each step handled by agents optimized for that specific task.</p>
<p>This mirrors how human teams work today. Establish direction, implement solutions, and ensure quality and consistency. The difference is speed and scale.</p>
<h2>The Future of Development</h2>
<p>The most powerful development environments won’t be those that simply generate code fastest. They’ll be systems that understand your specific codebase deeply and adapt to your team’s unique approach.</p>
<p>When you begin a project, you’ll decide upfront what you want: TypeScript, specific linting rules, run on Cloudflare. But beyond these technical choices, your AI system will learn what makes your codebase unique.</p>
<p>Unlike the patterns found in open source repositories, your AI agents will understand the complete picture of your application. They’ll recognize that teams evolve their own concepts and styles that may not match external patterns.</p>
<p>This is the natural progression from todays word-by-word generation to truly contextual development assistance.</p>
<p>It’s not just about writing code, it is about writing code that belongs.</p>

I used to have a great mp3 collection, you know, back in the days when it was almost considered legal.

<p>I used to have a great mp3 collection, you know, back in the days when it was almost considered legal.</p>
<p>It was an amazing feat to keep it up to date in Winamp and later iTunes with correct titles and album art. There came apps that focused solely on this catalogue part using online sources to update the metadata called ID3.</p>
<p>Then came Spotify and changed that completely. That time spent curating was just sunk cost and my well catalogued mp3s are probably on an old dying hard drive somewhere in the house.</p>
<p>This is the reality we must face when it comes to AI and as a developer I see this so vividly.</p>
<p>What used to be “LLMs cannot code” became “LLMs write bad code” and now “LLMs write ok code”.</p>
<p>So we shift focus and find a new weak spot: LLMs cannot fix bugs. Or I cannot understand the code it writes.</p>
<p>But then again, the code I struggle to understand, it can explain to me 99% of the time. The ability to both generate and explain complex code further diminishes our position as keepers of the technical knowledge.</p>
<p>We move the focus to what it cannot do while something else comes along that changes the playing field, a new Spotify emerges and changes it all.</p>
<p>LLMs with the context memory of your complete repository. With the knowledge of every commit and every connected ticket. That can understand the reason behind the change in an iterative fashion. You will not need to understand the code. It will need to understand the code.</p>
<p>You will need to understand what you want to achieve and why. This understanding of purpose becomes our core value proposition as technical professionals.</p>
<p>As AI Agents emerge and become reliable we will prompt it with “increase the convert rate by 10%, these are the amounts of visitors we have, make small changes until you reached your goal or you need my attention, you have one quarter”.</p>
<p>Why is this happening so quickly? There’s an economic incentive at play. Developer salaries, especially in Big Tech, have skyrocketed over the past decade. AI development may be running at a loss now, but it might be following the Starbucks playbook of crowd out competition first, then raise prices. Companies investing billions in AI aren’t doing it for novelty. They’re eyeing the massive labor costs they could eliminate. Right now AI is marketed as an assistant, but the financial motivation to replace rather than augment is powerful.</p>
<p>So where does this leave us as developers? We need to move up the value chain. If algorithms can handle implementation, we must master the intention behind it. This brings us back to first principles thinking.</p>
<p>These are the first principles that we aim at: Why do we build this service? What do the end users aim to solve?</p>
<p>This will be the hardest problem to understand and execute on. If my technical skills are not required as they used to be, what should I focus on instead?</p>
<p>History gives us a clue. In the past, key makers, cobblers and tailors used to be three separate jobs. As the market changed, their crafts were not needed to the same extent, but those who survived saw that with their dexterity they could adapt to new needs.</p>
<p>My view is that multiple technical crafts will join together, and our focus will shift toward the complete value chain rather than isolated implementation details. We’ll need to understand the whole picture to remain relevant.</p>
<p>Those first principles will not be: to write code.</p>

                    <description>How will we keep brand awareness when we use AI to generate our images? I see the same style cartoons popping up across business social networks. People generate fun images to pair with their messages. The visuals look cute but generic, completely out of brand and identical to everyone else’s. You might get some laughs. But nobody remembers which brand posted it. Is that temporary engagement worth sacrificing your visual identity?</description>

                    <description>The way diffusion models are trained is that they tag an existing image with what’s on it. Then they add a small amount of noise to that picture in iterations, following a carefully designed schedule, and finally end up with a black and white mess. The model specifically learns to predict what the “less noisy” version of an image should look like at each step.

                            <![CDATA[<p>The way diffusion models are trained is that they tag an existing image with what’s on it. Then they add a small amount of noise to that picture in iterations, following a carefully designed schedule, and finally end up with a black and white mess. The model specifically learns to predict what the “less noisy” version of an image should look like at each step.</p>
<p>Then when you want to create an image you start from a noisy image and add your prompt (i.e tag) and then it starts removing noise and starts iteratively doing this until you see an image. The text prompt is converted into a numerical representation that guides the denoising process.</p>
<p>Think of this as when you try to learn something new. You have some hooks in your brain from before, you start to add context, new lessons, new information and suddenly you see the areas somewhat clearer.</p>
<p>Most LLMs (ChatGPT, Mistral, Claude, Gemini and so on) usually write like we humans do. We add one word after another.</p>
<p>Diffusion based text models have started to appear. Think of them as working in reverse. You might input the last words like the ending of a script and then from complete noise it starts to add in words that make sense.</p>
<p>The model keeps refining this noisy text adding more coherent words until in the end we have something somewhat unique. This approach creates text quite differently from traditional word by word generation.</p>
<p>What does this mean for texts?</p>
<p>Since it is not constrained of left-to-right thinking the output can be more creative and surprising. It can solve potential issues where sequential models struggle with maintaining coherence across long passages. </p>
<p>In this way it mimics how creatives work. Moving from rough draft to refinement to polished work.</p>
<p>A future existence of multiple models that we can use in different parts of the creative flow is exciting.</p>

                    <description>There is a broad urgency focus when it comes to GenAI and how everyone can use it. But remember that urgent is not the same as important. Depending on who set the expectations urgent matters can become important to handle, not important to act on. The AI revolution demands we distinguish between what requires attention and what deserves action. Choose your priorities based on impact not hype.</description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As I pack up my bags to leave Copenhagen after spending some awesome days at #NAMS25, I’m reflecting on the conversations that dominated the event. Amid all the panels and presentations, one question kept surfacing: what happens when AI replaces us?</p>
<p>This isn’t speculation anymore as it’s become the underlying theme at almost every industry summit I’ve attended this year.</p>
<p>When we attend these events we seek human connection, perspectives and experiences. We want someone genuine being present and delivering insights that make our spider-senses go “what the heck!?”.</p>
<p>Nordic AI Media Summit 2025 delivered on this and went beyond. </p>
<p>But it got me thinking about other summits and presentations I’ve attended over the years. </p>
<p>Sometimes we feel immediately uncomfortable when someone is clearly just reading from a script. When the delivery sounds like a Dalek monotone or presentations lack visual pizzazz, we mentally check out and struggle to stay present even though the content is great.</p>
<p>We need a story or person we can connect with, whether positively or negatively, that demonstrates there’s an actual human sharing their personal perspective. It reminds me of that odd feeling when someone accepts an award via pre-recorded video. We feel cheated of the authentic experience we expected.</p>
<p>At NAMS25, these discussions about human authenticity intersected with questions about our future roles. If AI will replace much of what we do professionally, what remains uniquely human?</p>
<p>I believe this tension will reshape news media. AI will handle the facts, the police reports, the sports scores and the basic who-what-where of breaking news.</p>
<p>What remains uniquely human is our ability to provide context through lived experiences. AI can’t share what it felt like to be in the office the day after the last US election, how your commute to work was obstructed by someone removing a bridge.</p>
<p>Our future does not lie in competing with AI on data, but in the human connection, the unique local view of the community, what they have experienced and how to tell that story in the right context.</p>
<p>That perspective will be hard for algorithms to replicate.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Touch any prototype and everyone instantly realizes how far their mental model was from reality. </p>
<p>That moment of clarity, when abstract ideas collide with concrete implementation, remains one of the most powerful feelings in product development.</p>
<p>As we are getting closer to mid-2025, this fundamental truth starts to show a subtle misinformation in “AI will replace coders”. The narrative that suggests that coding careers are somewhat fruitless has proven more persistent and I would say potentially harmful than feared waves of mis-information and deep fakes that dominated discussions in 2024.</p>
<p>This parallel struck me while listening to panel discussion at <a href="https://www.nordicaijournalism.com/" title="Nordic AI Media Summit">NAMS25</a> today.</p>
<p>While the AI coding tools have evolved, as in they excel at generating code, they have not started bridging the super critical gap between what users say they want and what they actually need.</p>
<p>When someone types “Build me an app that does THIS”, a somewhat vague request, it starts a journey towards a valuable product. And that journey always comes with human judgment at multiple decision points.</p>
<p>The most valuable skills still remain uniquely human: breaking apart problems, systems thinking and the ability to translate between technical possibilities and actual human needs.</p>
<p>This is what makes AI tools so powerful in the right hands. They amplify capabilities that already exist, they don’t replace them.</p>
<p>For those making career decisions: Don’t shy away from development because AI’s rise. Instead focus on developing skills AI can’t replicate. Learn the skills to collaborate effectively with the tools and (this is crucial) maintain the human abilities that give tech its purpose.</p>
<p>Touching that first prototype and having the ability to recognize that this is not working that is the core skill we developers need.</p>

                    <description>As we might become mechanical turks just approving whatever AI outputs, will we be less and less interested in the output that we approve, and the tone of voice and standard it should uphold? The danger isn’t just putting humans in the loop but keeping us engaged in that loop. Without genuine interest our oversight becomes hollow ritual.</description>

<p>Tech debt isn’t solely an engineering issue. When designers create solutions without technical context, product managers can’t articulate clear user needs, or executives push for features without validation, we build the wrong things well rather than the right things simply.</p>
<p>The most dangerous misunderstandings come from solving theoretical problems instead of actual ones. We build complex, flexible frameworks anticipating edge cases that never materialize, leaving behind over-engineered systems that must be maintained without delivering proportional value.</p>

                    <description>All tech debt stems from misunderstanding three things: the problem (what we’re solving), the priorities (what matters most), or the code (how it actually works). It actually is that simple. We create tech debt when we work on things we think are interesting instead of what’s truly important (priorities), when we build before truly understanding the needs (problem), and when we work with old code without knowing why it works a certain way (code).</description>

                    <description>I try to drink less coffee, however my coffee machine makes really good coffee. When I turn it on to create a really good cup of coffee it stay on for about 45 minutes. After those minutes it turns itself off and cleans everything, and it is quite loud when it does this. I’ve realized that when this happens I’m always reminded of coffee. This makes me want to go and… grab coffee.

                            <![CDATA[<p>I try to drink less coffee, however my coffee machine makes really good coffee. When I turn it on to create a really good cup of coffee it stay on for about 45 minutes.</p>
<p>After those minutes it turns itself off and cleans everything, and it is quite loud when it does this. I’ve realized that when this happens I’m always reminded of coffee. This makes me want to go and… grab coffee.</p>
<p>This coffee machine scenario highlights a broader pattern I’ve noticed: our environment creates automatic triggers that can derail our intentions. Another example is how we use timers for productivity.</p>
<p>Getting into flow sometimes needs tools like setting a timer for 5 minutes to overcome initial resistance. I use this technique to commit to just “investing” 5 minutes in a task, which is usually enough to get started.</p>
<p>The problem with timers is when they go off… you get a Pavlovian response that you are done.</p>
<p>Breaking these loops might require changing the environment rather than fighting the response. Moving your workspace away from the coffee machine’s audible range eliminates the trigger entirely. Similarly, using visual timers like sand hourglasses instead of alarm sounds can help maintain flow while still tracking time.</p>
<p>The key is recognizing these automated triggers and redesigning them to align with your true intentions rather than working against them.</p>

<p>During the late 90s dot-com bubble, Sweden had its own tech superstars. Jonas Birgersson became known as “Broadband Jesus” for his vision of universal internet access through his company Framfab. Johan Staël von Holstein built Icon Medialab into a global player before the crash, while Ernst Malmsten and Kajsa Leander’s <a href="http://Boo.com">Boo.com</a> famously burned through massive venture capital in just 18 months before collapsing. <a href="http://Boo.com">Boo.com</a> epitomized being too early - their Flash-heavy website required significant bandwidth that most users simply didn’t have at the time.</p>
<p>What these companies share with today’s AI boom is striking: outsized hype about profitability and technology prioritized over utility. These entrepreneurs were creative people riding a wave of genuine possibility.</p>

<p>This shift essentially eliminated dedicated key makers as a profession. But those professionals didn’t vanish. The key industry pivoted toward security systems instead.</p>
<p>What we’re seeing over time is our human tendency to invent new professions that replace old ones.</p>
<p>We’re remarkably adaptive creatures. Just as cobblers became key makers when mass production changed their industry we’ll adapt to AI too.</p>
<p>Our history is defined by this continuous reinvention. When technologies shift we don’t disappear. We transform.</p>

                    <description>Björk released “Medúlla” in 2004, an album where about 80% of sounds come from human voices with minimal conventional instruments. As an artist who connects technology with nature, she imposed this vocal-only constraint deliberately. She challenged herself to create everything (basslines, percussion, atmospherics) using just the human throat. Instead of using everything at your disposal, set constraints to test your imagination.

                    <description>Preparing for presentations often involves getting stuck trying to create bridges between different sections. Forcing connections rarely works. What does work is reviewing the material, taking a step back and going for a walk without any devices or distractions. The simple act of getting blood flowing activates the brain in different ways.</description>

                    <description>My most effective tool for beating inertia is a 5-minute alarm app that stays silent when time’s up. It just keeps counting upward while displaying encouraging messages every minute. I only see these if I check the app. The concept is simple: I commit to just “investing” 5 minutes in a task. Those few minutes are usually all I need to get started and break through my resistance.</description>

In best of worlds they were comprehensive, capturing key facts and concepts that would be tested later. In worst of worlds they was just a indication on which page number in the books that you should read.</p>
<p>In meetings we learned to take notes for what was being said and what was being decided upon. The focus is on action items, ownership and deadlines.</p>
<p>AI note taking and transcripts are changing meeting notes into something more like school notes. “You actually said this, there is a record of it.” This brings accountability but loses something important.</p>
<p>What’s missing in these perfect transcripts is the context and human feeling around the meetings. The energy in the room when an idea was proposed. The hesitation before someone agreed. The enthusiasm that can’t be captured in words alone.</p>
<p>Different contexts require different note-taking strategies. The key is recognizing what each approach captures and what it leaves out.</p>

<p>Capturing everything misses the point entirely. What matters is recording your unique reaction to ideas. How they connect to your experiences or challenge your thinking.</p>
<p>The real value in personal notes is selective attention. This human filter is what turns random information into gold nuggets.</p>
<p>Your notes should reflect your thinking, not just what you heard. They’re a conversation between you and the content, capturing the sparks that light up your mind.</p>
<p>The magic is connecting the dots, those sparks when two oddly shaped pieces of information somehow connected in your brain and created something truly unique that only you could come up with. But that magic cannot happen when you store everything and try to remember everything to be able to connect everything.</p>

                    <description>The most valuable skills might be those AI can’t copy because they seem “useless” today. Take time to learn something with no clear payoff, it could become your advantage later. What looks pointless now might matter tomorrow. Just like alchemy experiments led to chemistry. The skills hardest to justify on a resume are often what separate human brilliance from machine efficiency. Think complex systems thinking, strategic procrastination, narrative weaving or deep listening without an agenda.</description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When I was seventeen, I broke my first computer. Twice.</p>
<p>The first time, I sheepishly sent it for repair. The second time, shame drove me to figure it out myself. Creating a boot floppy disk that could access the CD-ROM to reinstall Windows. I think that moment changed everything for me.</p>
<p>I learned three truths that possibly shaped my career:</p>
<ul>
<li>Breaking things isn’t fatal</li>
<li>The path forward often runs through mistakes</li>
<li>Self-reliance builds deeper understanding than following instructions</li>
</ul>
<p>In 1999, I entered the tech arena without formal education. There were no YouTube tutorials or Stack Overflow. Learning meant tinkering with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS until something worked.</p>
<p>This ‘constructive breaking’ mindset has carried me through multiple roles spanning development, management, and leadership. Without the identity anchor of formal credentials, I’ve never felt trapped in one specialty.</p>
<p>As generative AI increasingly writes code through simple natural language prompts, with tools like Lovable, Bolt, and Replit that can build entire websites and SaaS products, the most valuable skill won’t be expertise in syntax or current frameworks. It will be the courage to break things, the resilience to fix them, and the adaptability to understand what actually solves the problem at hand.</p>
<p>What we fear in the AI era isn’t just disappearing entry-level coding jobs, but the learning path they represent. If AI handles the ‘easy’ parts, how will developers grow? </p>
<p>The answer might be counterintuitive: we need more people willing to break AI’s output, question its solutions, and develop through deliberate experimentation. The junior role evolves from writing basic code to breaking sophisticated systems, creating a new and equally valuable learning path.</p>
<p>The future belongs to constructive breakers.</p>

                    <description>A few days ago I created Ghibli-style art with my kids using OpenAI’s upgraded image generator. “Make one of me” they asked with wide eyes. As perfect copies appeared with just a few words, I wondered: what makes an “original” anymore? This got me thinking about authenticity beyond copyright debates. When AI can create anything, how will we know who really made what? And then it hit me: Non-fungible token aka NFTs .

<p>A few days ago I created Ghibli-style art with my kids using OpenAI’s upgraded image generator. “Make one of me” they asked with wide eyes.</p>
<p>As perfect copies appeared with just a few words, I wondered: what makes an “original” anymore?</p>
<p>This got me thinking about authenticity beyond copyright debates. When AI can create anything, how will we know who really made what?</p>
<p>And then it hit me: Non-fungible token aka NFTs . Those blockchain certificates that crashed after their speculative bubble might actually serve their intended purpose now. With greener blockchain solutions emerging, NFTs could finally become something useful: digital authenticity markers when we need them most.</p>

                    <link>https://mattias.blog/idea-hoarding</link>
                    <description>People who guard their one big idea, fear they’ll never have another. This makes them stuck. Unable to discuss. Unable to move forward. Their minds become storage vaults rather than creative engines, just like when a midnight idea keeps you awake because you’re afraid to forget it.</description>

                    <description>When I started as a web developer there was a shortage of talent. You could learn, show your work, get hired. After the 2000 bubble burst, consistency and continuous learning kept careers alive. Today, people who can effectively prompt AI tools or integrate AI into workflows are finding opportunities—just like those who could build websites in 1998. You don’t need a PhD. Practical skills are what companies need. The pattern with AI is clear: shortage of skilled people now, then formal education...</description>

<p>The pattern with AI is clear: shortage of skilled people now, then formal education later. Focus on using and learning, and you’ll be fine. Just as with web development before it.</p>

                    <description>If you understand your organization, you’ll recognize the small ideas your leadership really wants. The ‘what if we could’ ideas. These are the ideas your boss or manager or owner wants to test but doesn’t dare ask for since it might be seen as micromanaging. This becomes especially valuable as companies grow beyond the size where owners can personally know everyone. Keep track of these ideas because they often surface in various projects.

<p>The ‘what if we could’ ideas.</p>
<p>These are the ideas your boss or manager or owner wants to test but doesn’t dare ask for since it might be seen as micromanaging.</p>
<p>This becomes especially valuable as companies grow beyond the size where owners can personally know everyone.</p>
<p>Keep track of these ideas because they often surface in various projects. They’re leadership’s pet peeves and concepts that are hard for them to ignore.</p>
<p>Try asking them directly: “Tell me about some ideas that you’ve had for our products that you think we need or should test?”</p>
<p>Remember that listening doesn’t always mean acting. Understanding these ideas gives you valuable insight even if you don’t implement them all. Sometimes leadership just wants to be heard not necessarily have every thought turned into a project.</p>

                    <link>https://mattias.blog/removing</link>
                    <description>I remember listening to a presentation by techno/drone/dub artist Andreas Tilliander. He told the story of how after an update of his MPC the displays had reversed the indicators of which sounds were playing and which were muted. He discovered this while performing on stage at a concert in Japan. The odd thing that happened was that the crowd went mental for the performance when he distilled the tracks to their most basic form. Sometimes we need less to be impactful.</description>

<p>This mindset works beyond improv. Whether in sales conversations, colleague discussions, or daily life, choosing “yes and” over “yes but” opens doors instead of building walls. It shifts us from defensive reactions to constructive dialogue.</p>

                    <description>Maybe the solution to feeling like an impostor isn’t to get better at pretending. It’s to stop pretending altogether. Being a professional is always being an impostor, we always do things out of our comfort zone. Imagine if we spent that energy on the work instead of the performance.</description>

                    <description>Too often we chase perfection. We filter out the “bad” ideas before they see daylight, thinking we’re saving time. But innovation rarely comes from perfect ideas. It comes from collisions between different thoughts, good and bad alike. Think of it like improv: “yes, and…” We need more raw material to play with. More ideas to bounce around, even the “bad” ones.</description>

                    <description>We say it worked better when we were all in the same place. That we were more innovative. More in tune. But I think we’re nostalgic for a time when we didn’t have options. We could only have workshops together in conference rooms. That’s where everything happened. The aha moments. The breakthroughs. That correlation is what makes us think it was good. But it was the only thing we had.</description>

<p>Planning can be rigid and lead us down specific paths. The idea of knowing the destination and just going along.</p>
<p>Preparing is about setting the stage, building capabilities and staying flexible.</p>
<p>3M, the company behind every agile coach’s favorite accessory (the Post-it), prepares for innovation by giving employees 15% of their time to experiment and spot opportunities. One such opportunity was the failed adhesive experiment that lead to a somewhat sticky mess that made up the adhesive for post-its.</p>
<p>This approach to culture set the stage for innovation to emerge naturally rather than forcing it through rigid plans.</p>
<p>Another example is Design Sprints, a five day workshop that originated from Google Ventures which purpose is to verify a new idea. Planning handles the schedule, the five days and their structure. But the real magic comes from preparation: identifying the right challenge, finding the right people to interview, and selecting the right participants. Without proper preparation, even a perfectly planned sprint won’t lead to meaningful innovation.</p>
<p>While planning is crucial for execution, preparing is key for innovation.</p>

                    <link>https://mattias.blog/productivity-is-reducing-waste</link>
                    <description>Productivity isn’t about doing more. It’s about choosing what we do. When I watch a specific YouTuber playing games, I’m making an active choice. I know what I want. I pick the content. I enjoy the experience. But when I mindlessly swipe through reels or shorts, I’m just reacting. The algorithm chooses for me. I’m not in control. This is the difference between productivity and waste. Productivity happens when we actively choose. Waste happens when we passively react.</description>

                    <link>https://mattias.blog/puzzle-or-balance</link>
                    <description>In Swedish we call the complicated task of living, working, being a parent, taking vacation, cleaning or meeting friends managing the life puzzle. Is puzzle really the best word for this? Would life balance be better? Puzzles have a tendency to be finished. But life puzzles will never be done. The only way it could be like a real puzzle is if someone keeps hiding pieces or dragging it to the floor.</description>

                    <link>https://mattias.blog/ai-slop</link>
                    <description>I really like the term Slop. One of those ideophonic words that feels like it means. AI Slop has become like a shorthand word to summarize quickly produced and often indistinguishable content that floods SoMe and you inbox with newsletters. In the 1500s and forward slop came to describe cheap and ready-made clothing and in 1800s it was associated with mass-produced, low-quality clothing produced by workers with little to no rights or regulations. Slop has always been about quantity over quality.</description>

                    <description>One of the biggest habit changes is scheduling. I’ve seen such an improvement when I block time for tasks and ensure I’m ready to start immediately. Take making music for example. I don’t want to waste time setting up equipment. plugging everything in and opening apps before I can start creating. That’s too much friction. Instead pick a few key tools. Make them instantly available. Schedule your time and just go.</description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In the mid-1800s, Isaac Singer made two changes that transformed an industry. He invented an affordable sewing machine and sold it with a payment plan. Workshops and individuals could now access technology previously limited to manufacturers. Within decades, thousands of small producers replaced the few professionals who had controlled the industry.</p>
<p>We’re at a similar threshold for AI and software as a service (SaaS). The tools to build software are becoming more accessible every day.</p>
<p>It makes creation possible for everyone. Small teams and individuals can now build tools in days and weeks instead of months and years. Technical complexity that once required years of experience and specialized knowledge is now simplified with AI that can write code, design interfaces, and implement features using natural language.</p>
<p>However, Singer’s sewing machines didn’t eliminate the need for basic sewing skills and AI tools won’t remove the requirement for basic tech knowledge. What changes is the barrier to entry.</p>
<p>Like Singer paved the way for thousands of at-home tailors, I predict thousands of specialized micro-SaaS products emerging at relatively low costs.</p>
<p>Established SaaS companies face a crucial tipping point. Will they become the Singer of the AI age, adapting their business models to this new reality?</p>
<p>History suggests that when barriers collapse, markets change permanently. We saw it with Kodak losing to digital cameras, Blockbuster missing out on streaming, and AltaVista bypassed by a single input field.</p>

Fans probably spotted the pattern early but the rest of us found it after she became mega-successful and toured the world.

<p>There is something special with patterns that emerge and things that feel and sound good. Think about classic I, IV, and V chords that make up a lot of songs. The feelings is that you recognize it and feel comforted about it, and combined together with a familiar rhythm in the song, you feel complete.</p>
<p>When you create something that feels out of your comfort zone, you don’t follow patterns you are used to. You go with your own tune with your own beat. And this is a power when it comes to being the new kid on the block.</p>
<p>You don’t need to follow the ways of big successful organizations. They’ve found one way and often stick with it. Patterns and behaviours that become chains that make change much harder.</p>
<p>New companies bring a fresh view. A clear vision that isn’t watered down by inner politics and competing priorities within big companies.</p>
<p>They can pivot quickly. Try new things. Change their vision voice and tone in an instant.</p>
<p>That’s the superpower of new businesses.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This reminds me of my first Fallout 4 playthrough. I tried to make my character equally good at everything. Just like when I became an engineering manager and saw that skill matrix spider web. I automatically assumed I needed to max out every area.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing: being average at everything isn’t as valuable as being exceptional at specific things. Some of our “flaws” are just areas we’ve chosen not to prioritize. And that’s okay.</p>
<p>Like that piano chord in Roxanne sometimes our mistakes and imperfections become our signature. Our strength isn’t in being flawless. It’s in owning the mistakes and the imperfections.</p>

                    <description>At Spotify I worked a bit on the Alexa speakers and had meetings with Amazon. This is where I first learned about the “silent meetings” structure that Amazon had. They usually began with someone having written a document on the topic, different viewpoints, and a possible way forward. The first 10-15 minutes of the meeting went into reading this document.

                            <![CDATA[<p>At Spotify I worked a bit on the Alexa speakers and had meetings with Amazon. This is where I first learned about the “silent meetings” structure that Amazon had. They usually began with someone having written a document on the topic, different viewpoints, and a possible way forward. The first 10-15 minutes of the meeting went into reading this document. And once everyone was literally on the same page, the meetings started. The discussions were engaging, and everyone was focusing on solving the same problems.</p>
<p>There are key parallels between Amazon’s silent meetings and the flipped classroom model: both rely on everyone starting with the same information before discussion begins. When done right teachers become coaches guiding students through shared material rather than lecturers delivering new content.</p>
<p>When I’ve experienced a working flipped classroom, it has been all about the “silent reading” part. The students all started from the same baseline when it came to the information. They worked together in small groups summarizing it, then shared with a bigger group about what they learned.</p>
<p>This is often when I’ve seen the flipped classroom break. Instead of having the same baseline, each group has had a different set of topics and areas they should summarize and teach to the rest of the group. Effectively they’ve switched from an experienced teacher to an amateur teacher, and they’ve only learned the topics they themselves have discussed. The method works best when it builds on shared understanding rather than dividing the learning experience.</p>

                    <link>https://mattias.blog/the-cost-of-developing-something-yourself</link>
                    <description>Sometimes I get the question about build vs buy. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a developer by heart and I’d always pick build. But as a manager or leader I most often pick buy. The equation rarely adds up when you build something that’s not part of your core business. Unless your core business is faced with a tight budget. And by equation I mean time. Hours spent building, making it better, bug-fixing, upgrading, new feature, planning, sorting, prioritizing it, knowledge sharing.</description>

<p>I remember when we introduced this at Spotify. Leadership felt it took way too long to make decisions - almost like paralysis by analysis. But once understood it was a fairly simple shift to get teams moving faster.</p>
<p>There are very few decisions we can’t reverse if they fail. Consent helps us move quickly toward either failure or success. Continuing to analyze and second guess rarely moves us forward.</p>
<p>One challenge with consent is that someone needs to make a stand. If discussions are endless then it might not be consent that’s lacking. It might be that no one cares strongly enough to put a stake in the ground. Or worse it might be a sign that no one feels psychologically safe to make a mistake.</p>

                    <description>One pattern I see is that we approach all AI with a similar mindset, an industrial mindset that focuses on production metrics and output targets. While AI excels at production, Generative AI’s real value might lie in distillation and discovery. Think of it as a lens for spotting connections and extracting insights rather than a factory churning out content.

<p>Earlier AI focused on clear tasks (recognize this, predict that, sort these) and it was easy to measure if the results were better. </p>
<p>But generative AI opens new possibilities for exploration and creativity. Yet we measure it with industrial era metrics and we see it in all benchmarks that the Generative AI companies share when they release a new model.</p>
<p>The power isn’t in producing more, but in helping us see different angles and uncover unexpected patterns. Quality over quantity. Insight over output.</p>
<p>The question shifts from ‘How can we create more?’ to ‘How can we discover better?’&quot;</p>

<p>Here’s the truth though: Bad art teaches you more than perfect planning ever will. </p>
<p>Maybe instead of trying to get everything right we should just create something terrible on purpose. Make that awful track. Write that horrible story. Take those bad photos.</p>
<p>Because really. What’s braver? Having the perfect plan or actually making something?</p>

<p>Most people stick to either talking or writing when processing thoughts. But you might get better results in combining the spontaneity in verbal processing and the structure of written words</p>
<p><strong>Start talking.</strong> Let yourself ramble on a topic without filters. Just let the ideas tumble out.</p>
<p><strong>Then bring it to AI.</strong> It captures your ramblings and reflects them back in text form. No judgment. No interruptions.</p>
<p>Now read the response. This is where scattered thoughts begin to make sense. Reading slows your brain down. Helps you spot patterns in your own ramblings.</p>
<p>It’s like having two thinking modes: creative outpour and thoughtful reflection. Your brain needs both to turn raw thoughts into clear ideas.</p>

<p>Directors sitting at their desks saying “I want a moody scene. Start with a low angle shot that slowly pans up to reveal a cityscape at dawn.” And then uses AI powered tools to create it.</p>
<p>Sharing vision becomes easier. Instead of struggling to explain what’s in your head you can show it. “Here’s the vibe I want” becomes a starting point not hours of back and forth.</p>
<p>Creating becomes less about technical skills and more about creativity. We’ll spend less time figuring out how to make something and more time deciding what stories need to be told.</p>
<p>Think of Harvey Pekar before he met R. Crumb. Amazing comic ideas trapped in his head because he couldn’t draw. Soon that barrier between imagination and creation disappears.</p>
<p>The tools are becoming easier. The ideas will become everything.</p>

Similar to path of least resistance where water naturally flows downhill taking the easiest route. We tend to pick the things that are easier or use less time. Most often we pick the path of most comfortable.</description>

<p>Let me share a recent example. A company decided to use a shared ChatGPT account to save money. One day. the owner started a new chat with the topic “How to fire people”. This was visible to everyone using that account.</p>
<p>Even though you think a service is secure. moving data anywhere online means it can end up in the wrong hands. Your “deleted” content lives on in endless iterations as backups. archives. and screenshots.</p>
<p>And when you’re using shared accounts? The risks multiply. Your private information becomes accessible to everyone with access.</p>
<p>Always remember: Nothing is truly private online.</p>

<p>Focus on four things: construct, scope, assumptions, and reduction.</p>
<p><strong>Construct</strong> “What”, “How”, and “Tell” are excellent question starters that can help with reflective thinking. “Why”, “Who”, “When” limit our responses.</p>
<p><strong>Scope</strong> Ask from the point of view that you must take, be it a stakeholder or your own.</p>
<p><strong>Assumptions</strong> In many great questions, there are inherent assumptions, make sure that you know yours and how to use them for benefit.</p>
<p><strong>Reduction</strong> Do you want to reduce the output or response that you get? Example: “Tell me about yourself” vs “Tell me your three favourite movies, growing up”</p>
<p>Friendly reminder: answers can be strange, odd, and bad.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every answer is someone’s interpretation of the truth. A question is a desire to understand that truth. - Darko Vukovic</p>
</blockquote>

                    <title>One of the dozen problems</title>
                    <link>https://mattias.blog/one-of-the-dozen-problems</link>
                    <description>I really like Richard Feynman’s idea of having a dozen problems that you actively search for answers to. Then whenever you learn something new, you can test it against these problems. One of my problems is “What can you focus on as engineering manager if you can no longer scale? Is it only faster, cheaper, reduction of complexity? Or perhaps quality improvements, developer experience, system reliability, or team capabilities?”</description>

                    <description>Do you recall the last time you took a picture of a sunset? Unless you are a professional photographer it probably looked terrible on your phone. Building your own products can feel the same way. We judge their external polished front with how our messy process, discussions or iterations feel.</description>

                    <description>I’ve struggled with estimates for years. We’re asked “how long will this take?” as if we’re building something we’ve built before. But in product development we’re creating something new every time, within the constraints of our tech stack, frameworks, and past decisions. Many teams are starting to talk about appetite instead of estimates. It changes everything about how we approach the work.

<p>We’re asked “how long will this take?” as if we’re building something we’ve built before. But in product development we’re creating something new every time, within the constraints of our tech stack, frameworks, and past decisions.</p>
<p>Many teams are starting to talk about appetite instead of estimates. It changes everything about how we approach the work. Instead of “can we build exactly this?” we ask “what’s the best we can build in the time this is worth?”</p>
<p>To get to a meaningful appetite:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start by understanding the problem you want to solve</li>
<li>Know why it matters now</li>
<li>Be clear about desired outcomes</li>
<li>Decide what investment makes sense</li>
</ul>
<p>Then bring all of this context to your team. Let them understand not just the time box. But the why. Because an appetite isn’t a time constraint. It’s a value decision about how much of your company’s resources should focus on this solution.</p>

                    <title>Expectation and disagreements</title>
                    <link>https://mattias.blog/expectation-and-disagreements</link>
                    <description>Problems start when what you expect doesn’t match what actually happens. Be explicit of what you expect and make sure you understand what is expected. When conflict arise, take a step back and check if it is simply a case of different expectations. I’ve often seen disagreements that are just people working from different assumptions.</description>

<p>When you ask for feedback you should be clear about what kind of feedback you need. </p>
<p>If you have written a post, do you want feedback on the punctuation, spelling or commas. Or do you want feedback on the order of things, if the story flows, does the order make sense. </p>
<p>Think about this when you ask for feedback. What do you want to improve, then sit back and enjoy. Some of the feedback will be hard. Some will be inspiring. Some will be important. Others you can ignore. </p>

                    <description>The concept of Dead Internet Theory is intriguing for me. The idea that bots will influence what is important so that other bots will make content that focuses on those bots behavior. It creates a bizarre ecosystem where AI systems essentially talk to each other, generating more online activity than actual human users ever could.</description>

                    <description>When it comes to expression and creativity, you need to use the simplest app. Any friction when you try to capture those “hard to create” ideas is lost the moment between “Enter App. Wait. Ohh where do I add a new…”. You just need to sprint in capturing those ideas. Always have a paper close, a shortcut to open your notes app, a button press away to record your ideas. Teach your brain that ideas are important and that it can trust that the ideas it creates will end up somewhere.</description>

                    <description>Trust isn’t built through superhero moments. It’s earned in small gestures. You build trust by being present when someone needs you. It happens when you ask how they’re doing. When you listen. When you remember what they shared. These tiny moments add up. They matter more than any grand gesture ever could.</description>

                    <description>You will get outcompeted by people who genuinely love what you only do for money. And you will get outcompeted by people who embrace change. While you cling to old knowledge like a sunk cost, afraid to let go of what you’ve learned, change will happen and the world around you will move on. I’ve seen this firsthand. From coding in the 90s out of pure interest. To managing teams. And now building complete products with AI.</description>

<p>Focus on the 3Cs: Clarity, Capacity and Collaboration.</p>
<h2>Clarity</h2>
<p>How can increase clarity for the team? Does everyone know what we are working on and why we are working on it? Can I make our current goals clear, our prioritization crystal and our targets obvious?</p>
<h2>Capacity</h2>
<p>Can I make our capacity visible? Do we have the time, skills and energy we need? Should we bring in outside perspective or knowledge? Are we working on too many things? </p>
<h2>Collaboration</h2>
<p>Can I identify and propose opportunities for collaboration? Can we work together on prioritized initiatives? Can we discuss challenges and find solutions together? Can we commit to reach out to others when we are stuck? </p>
<p>When either of these is lacking the team will focus on the wrong goals, they will be slower and cause friction, work in silos, make complicated solutions and will miss out on innovation.</p>
<p>The sweet spot is when all of this works.</p>
<h2>Implementation Note</h2>
<p>The power of this framework isn’t in formally announcing it, but in using it as a leadership compass to guide your team. Like good coaching, it’s about consistently creating an environment where these elements can thrive, especially when dealing with changing priorities from above. The framework becomes most effective when it feels natural rather than forced.</p>

                    <description>After exploring different ways of storing my notes, I’ve developed a system inspired by a plentiful of productive gurus. I call it CUP and it stands for Cabinet, Unfold and Play. Cabinet The Cabinet is a spin on the Cabinet of Curiosities and this is where I store most of my notes. The Cabinet is more than just storage - it’s a curated collection of knowledge, ideas, and inspiration. Like the historical cabinets of curiosities, it’s where we keep our most interesting findings.

<p>I call it CUP and it stands for <strong>Cabinet</strong>, <strong>Unfold</strong> and <strong>Play</strong>.</p>
<h2>Cabinet</h2>
<p>The Cabinet is a spin on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_curiosities">Cabinet of Curiosities</a> and this is where I store most of my notes. The Cabinet is more than just storage - it’s a curated collection of knowledge, ideas, and inspiration. Like the historical cabinets of curiosities, it’s where we keep our most interesting findings. This could include book notes, research, interesting articles, concepts, or any piece of information worth preserving.<br>

<h2>Unfold</h2>
<p>Unfold captures life as it happens. By keeping daily notes, meeting logs, and journal entries here, we create a chronological story of our days. Through backlinks, these daily captures stay connected to our broader work, making it easy to trace how ideas and projects develop over time.</p>
<h2>Play</h2>
<p>By choosing “Play” over “Projects,” we create a space that invites creativity and experimentation. This section houses our active work and responsibilities, but approaches them with a lighter, more engaging mindset. Whether it’s writing, coding, or planning, framing it as play helps maintain curiosity and reduces the pressure we often associate with traditional project management.</p>
<hr>
<p>Like the name suggests, CUP is a container - but one that’s designed to grow and evolve with our needs and interests.</p>

<p>Like hanging onto a jacket that no longer fits just because it used to be our favorite. We often cling to old dreams and ambitions that we’ve outgrown.</p>
<p>Are we still trying to achieve the goals of our past selves? Following an outdated map. Moving in a direction that no longer excites us.</p>
<p>Remember - the real failure isn’t in changing direction or letting go. The real failure is staying stuck. Doing nothing. Being afraid to admit we’ve changed. Every step forward teaches us something new about ourselves. Even if it means leaving old dreams behind.</p>
<p>Is this still your dream? Or are you just afraid to let it go?</p>

                    <description>We’re living in a world obsessed with output, heck even this page is a proof-of-it. Our economic systems reward quantity, and now AI tools let us create more content than ever before. As business publishing evolved from 500-page bricks to concentrated 30 minute reads, we might see a similar shift in digital content. People don’t want more, they want better. They want signal, not noise. The real question for the future will not be “How much can we produce?” it will be “How can we deliver value...</description>

<p>As business publishing evolved from 500-page bricks to concentrated 30 minute reads, we might see a similar shift in digital content.</p>
<p>People don’t want more, they want better. They want signal, not noise.</p>
<p>The real question for the future will not be “How much can we produce?” it will be “How can we deliver value with less?”.</p>

                    <description>We often jump straight to solutions before really understanding the problem. It’s backwards, right? When our ideas are too polished from the start, we leave no room for others to contribute. That’s why rough ideas work better for team innovation.

                    <description>Scope creep is often a consequence of discovery. We don’t know what we don’t know. You can plan all that you want, but you’ll only find the true complexity once you dig in. We uncover all sorts of edge cases when we start working, and that is equal to developers, project managers and customers.</description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>I have a confession: I’ve never been a fan of SMART goals. There, I said it.</p>
<p>They first came into my life through personal development programs and they felt more like a forced exercise than a useful tool.</p>
<p>SMART goals were created for managing companies and projects back in 1981 and somehow they became the go-to framework for personal development. Leadership experts everywhere pushed them as the solution. But just because something works for corporate planning doesn’t mean it translates well to individual growth.</p>
<p>As a team leader, I struggle when setting SMART goals with my team members. This is especially true for creative or thinking-intensive work. These goals often become binary checkboxes. They’re either done or not done. This misses the nuance of real progress.</p>
<p>Recently I discovered Ali Abdaal’s NICE goals framework. It resonates much better with how people actually develop and grow. </p>
<p>Let’s break it down:</p>
<p><strong>Near term:</strong> Focus on what you can do today, tomorrow, or next week. It’s about the immediate future, not some distant target.</p>
<p><strong>Input Based:</strong> Instead of focusing on outcomes we can’t control, concentrate on actions we can take right now. What specific steps can you take to move forward?</p>
<p><strong>Controllable:</strong> Choose goals within your sphere of influence. Running ten miles daily might be unrealistic, but how about 10 minutes? You might not control what work lands on your desk, but you can control how you approach it.</p>
<p><strong>Energizing:</strong> Make your goals exciting. Ask yourself: “How could this project be fun?” or “What could I teach others about this?” Find ways to inject energy into your goals.</p>
<p>The beauty of NICE goals is that they work with human nature. They acknowledge that personal development is more complex than a checkbox system from the 80s.</p>

                    <description>Core values written on walls mean nothing if they don’t match what happens beneath the surface. Your real values show up in daily choices: which behavior gets rewarded who gets promoted and how conflicts are solved. What you tolerate becomes your culture regardless of what your handbook states. The gap between stated and lived values is where most company cultures fall apart.</description>

                    <description>Like an iceberg, your company culture runs far deeper than what’s visible on the surface. Processes and structures are just the tip, showing only a fraction of what matters. The real force lies beneath in how people think, act, and influence others daily. This invisible part isn’t written down in handbooks. It’s lived and shared through the decisions being made.</description>

Even when we’re swimming in data and have gathered every possible opinion, it usually comes down to a leap of judgment at some point. Think about it.

<p>Think about it. It starts with gut feeling right from the beginning: deciding which data we should even bother collecting, which customers we should talk to, and what questions are worth asking. Then later, when we’re stuck choosing between two solutions or strategies that both look equally good on paper, it’s often that same gut feeling, backed by experience, that helps us make the final call.</p>
<p>That’s why senior leaders are so valuable. They’ve been through countless situations and have honed their instincts. Is it perfect? No way. But it’s often the best tool we have for navigating those tricky gaps between the data, the opinions, and all the things we just don’t know.</p>
<p>Decisions that really drive results need both data and opinions along with wisdom. Sometimes you simply need to trust your judgment. It’s that straightforward.</p>

<p>You need to be realistic. Technology moves fast and effective leadership requires both learning and coding.</p>
<p>When to code and what to code is like playing 4D chess. You need to look ahead and ask where the team needs to be in a year. What can you code today that will make future decisions easier?</p>
<p>Future decisions don’t always mean “let’s try this cool innovative thing.” It can also mean asking “Should we spend time on tech debt?”</p>
<p>It’s not about being in the way of progress. It’s about helping the team focus on what’s most important right now.</p>

<p>This creates what I call reverse FOMO. Instead of team members being afraid of missing out, leaders become anxious about not including everyone in every conversation, decision, or update.</p>
<p>There are two problems with this approach:</p>
<ol>
<li>It overwhelms people with information they don’t need. Not everyone needs to know everything about every project or decision. </li>
<li>It actually makes it harder for people to find the information that is relevant to them.</li>
</ol>
<p>There’s also a small shift of responsibility happening. When we put everything in the open, we sometimes use it as a shield: “Well, I shared it, so it’s on them if they didn’t read it.” This isn’t leadership - it’s avoiding our responsibility to communicate effectively.</p>
<p>Good transparency isn’t about sharing everything. It’s about sharing the right information with the right people at the right time.</p>
<p>If you are servant leader, then your role is to remove obstacles or create clarity for your team. Sharing everything is not reducing obstacles.</p>

                    <description>Control always comes at the expense of learning. When we are learning we must choose uncertainty and be willing to make mistakes. A child must let go of control and risk falling when learning to walk. A company needs to loose control to innovate or adapt.</description>

                    <description>When there is higher ambiguity, more importance is placed on processes. Ambiguity in goals, priorities, or vision from leadership often reflects a systemic issue, forcing processes to emerge from the bottom up as a way to compensate for the lack of clear direction. Good process serves you so you can serve customers. But if you’re not watchful, the process can become the thing. This can happen very easily in large organizations. - Jeff Bezos</description>

Reluctance to delegate often comes from a fear of losing control. Instead of worrying about what you’re missing, focus on your role in the delegation process. Delegation isn’t rigid or black-and-white; here are seven flexible ways to approach it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Delegate:</strong> Others take decisions that you don’t even want to know about.</li>
<li><strong>Inquire:</strong> Others decide, but you can ask for more information if you want.</li>
<li><strong>Advise:</strong> You give advice, hoping others will listen, but the decision is theirs.</li>
<li><strong>Agree:</strong> You and others discuss and come to an agreement on what to do.</li>
<li><strong>Consult:</strong> You ask for input from others and consider their arguments when making your decision.</li>
<li><strong>Sell:</strong> You’ve made your decision, but you put effort into selling your idea to others to get them onboard.</li>
<li><strong>Tell:</strong> You make the decision with no delegation at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>When delegating: Instead of thinking how you’ll miss out. Think about how you want to be involved.</p>

                    <description>Remember the mobile-first revolution? It changed how we design websites by focusing on essential features. Now, it’s time for a similar shift in data collection and analytics. From Desktop Kings to Mobile Natives Once, desktop users ruled the web. Websites were feature-packed playgrounds.

                            <![CDATA[<p>Remember the mobile-first revolution? It changed how we design websites by focusing on essential features. Now, it’s time for a similar shift in data collection and analytics.</p>
<h2>From Desktop Kings to Mobile Natives</h2>
<p>Once, desktop users ruled the web. Websites were feature-packed playgrounds. Mobile users got the short end of the stick with stripped-down “m.” versions. Then the mobile-first revolution hit. It prioritized mobile users and essential features, leaving the extras for desktop.</p>
<h2>The Post-GDPR Wake-Up Call</h2>
<p>Today, data privacy laws like GDPR, CCPA and ePR have changed the game. We can’t hoard user data anymore. This new landscape calls for a “data-minimalist” approach. Collect only what’s necessary. Treat additional data as a luxury, collected only with user consent.</p>
<h2>Transactional Anonymity: The New Standard</h2>
<p>Tracking users from start to finish is over. Regulations demand a level of transactional anonymity. It’s like walking into a store. You browse, choose, and buy. No prying eyes. Only essential data points, maybe some context if the customer opts in.</p>
<h2>The Re-Rise of UX and Qualitative Research</h2>
<p>In a world of limited data, we need to put User Experience and qualitative research in the spotlight again. UX isn’t a nice-to-have; it’s a must-have. It’s about understanding user needs and behaviors with the data we can ethically collect. Qualitative research adds the human touch that numbers alone can’t capture.</p>
<h2>AI’s Role in Limited Data</h2>
<p>AI comes into the picture here. It can analyze limited data sets and extract meaningful insights. Combine that with UX findings, and you get a complete view of what users really want and need.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s not just about less; it’s about better</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mobile-first revolution taught us to focus on essentials. Now, let’s apply that to data collection. As we adapt to new privacy norms, UX and qualitative research will become crucial. They’ll work alongside AI to help us create ethical, transparent, and user-friendly platforms. It’s not just about less; it’s about better.</p>

It highlights the immense value that data brings to businesses. But is ‘gold’ the best metaphor to describe the vast, dynamic potential of data? Let’s think about this a bit differently.

                            <![CDATA[<p>We’ve all heard it: “Data is the new gold.” It’s a catchy phrase that highlights how valuable data has become. It highlights the immense value that data brings to businesses. But is ‘gold’ the best metaphor to describe the vast, dynamic potential of data? Let’s think about this a bit differently.</p>
<h2>The Gold Standard</h2>
<p>Gold is shiny, valuable, and always in demand. Much like data, right? But there’s a catch. Gold just sits there. It doesn’t grow or change. Data, on the other hand, has the potential to transform our businesses in amazing ways and this is where the gold analogy may fall short.</p>
<h2>Seeds of Potential</h2>
<p>Imagine that we shift our perspective and compare data to seeds. Under the right conditions a seed can grow into a tall tree that bears fruits for years. Data holds a similar dynamic potential. A potential that can only be realized with the right nurturing.</p>
<h2>Cultivating Insights</h2>
<p>Just as a seed needs soil, water and sun, our data needs tools, the right people and timely action. If we don’t use or analyze our data, it’s like letting seeds go unplanted.</p>
<h2>Quality is Key</h2>
<p>Farmers know the importance of starting with high-quality seeds. Similar to data, garbage in means garbage out. If we start with unreliable data, our results won’t be trustworthy.</p>
<h2>Diverse Data, Diverse Outcomes</h2>
<p>There are countless types of seeds, and each one grows a different plant. Similarly, each type of data tells its own unique story. By understanding what each set of data can offer, we can make the most of it.</p>
<h2>Embracing the Seed Mindset</h2>
<p>Thinking of data as seeds gives a forward-looking view. It emphasizes nurturing, growth and realizing potential rather than mere storage. It’s a call to action: to not let our data sit idle but to cultivate it, nurture it and watch it flourish into strategies and insights.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Organizing information has always been an evolving challenge. From our early days in school categorizing subjects, to our adult lives where we’re flooded with digital content, finding the best way to store and access this information is paramount.<br>
The productivity expert, Tiago Forté, introduced The PARA Method in his “Building a Second Brain”-workshops and book. Now he has released a book addressing this specific area.</p>
<h2>Understanding PARA</h2>
<p>PARA stands for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Projects</strong>: These are the active outcomes you’re committed to achieving within a specific timeframe. It could be work tasks, personal hobbies, or side gigs. Unlike the broad categorization many of us have been conditioned to in school such as Math and History, these are specific outputs you’re currently involved in.</li>
<li><strong>Areas</strong>: Denoting ongoing responsibilities, these are domains where you aim to maintain a certain standard. Professionally, it could be evolving as a leader or learning new skills. Personally, it might involve health, hobbies, or your child’s school notes.</li>
<li><strong>Resources</strong>: This is your trove of ongoing interests. Whether it’s recipes, inspirational quotes, Pinterest boards, or subjects you’re researching out of sheer curiosity, these are not necessarily tied to any active project or responsibility but might be useful in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Archives</strong>: Your backup storage. Completed projects, past responsibilities, and even resources that no longer hold relevance find a place here. They’re like memories – not immediately useful but worth retaining for occasional reference.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Dynamics of PARA</h2>
<p>This method calls for a transition from broad subjects to an outcome-focused organization. Projects demand immediate attention; Areas require periodic oversight; Resources are a goldmine for future projects; and Archives are your treasure chest of past experiences.</p>
<p>When adopting PARA, ensure the system remains fluid. Just like a stagnant pond loses its charm, your PARA system will decline in utility if not periodically refreshed.</p>
<h2>Easy Steps to Set Up PARA</h2>
<p>Set up a consistent structure across all your systems or apps where you store files.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Set Up Basic Folders</strong>: Begin with these five main folders:
<ul>
<li>0. Inbox</li>
<li>1. Projects</li>
<li>2. Areas</li>
<li>3. Resources</li>
<li>4. Archives</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Clear Current Clutter</strong>: If you already have a lot of files, place them in a new folder in Archives with today’s date. Think of this as starting fresh, and you can do this anytime you feel overwhelmed.</li>
<li><strong>Organize Your Projects</strong>: Name your folders clearly with the goal and deadline, like: “Q1 Roadmap - Due 2023-12-01”.</li>
<li>Don’t worry about filling the Areas and Resources folders yet.</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s the basic setup! Now, just save all new items in the Inbox.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.mattias.blog/para-folders.jpg" alt="Folders in Evernote, Finder/MacOs and Google Drive" title="Folders in Evernote, Finder/MacOs and Google Drive"></p>
<h3><strong>Weekly Clean-Up</strong></h3>
<p>Every week, spend about five minutes to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rename items in your Inbox.</li>
<li>Move these items to the right PARA folders, prioritizing the most urgent ones. If a suitable folder doesn’t exist, create one.</li>
<li>Review and update ongoing projects.</li>
<li>Finished with a project or no longer overseeing an area? Move it to Archives. But if it contains actionable items relevant to other projects, transfer them there instead of archiving.</li>
</ul>
<h2>A Paradigm Shift</h2>
<p>The PARA Method is more than just an organizational tool; it’s a mindset shift. It encourages proactive organization, balancing between immediate tasks and future possibilities. By leveraging PARA, you’re not only ensuring easy access to information but also enhancing your productivity and fostering a structured, yet flexible, mindset. Whether you’re planning your next big venture or penning down personal reflections, PARA ensures your ideas and information are always within easy reach.</p>

                    <link>https://mattias.blog/achieving-harmony-in-goals</link>
                    <description>The world of product management and organizational alignment has found its melody in Objectives and Key Results (OKRs). They’re designed to be our guiding score, ensuring every department and individual plays in tune with the company’s vision.

                            <![CDATA[<p>The world of product management and organizational alignment has found its melody in Objectives and Key Results (OKRs). They’re designed to be our guiding score, ensuring every department and individual plays in tune with the company’s vision. Yet, as with any musical composition, there can be missteps or discordant notes. The key is recognizing these and adjusting for a harmony.</p>
<p>Using OKRs should be reminiscent of orchestrating a symphony. Each element, whether it’s an instrument or a goal, plays a part in creating a unified, captivating performance.</p>
<h2>Too Many OKRs</h2>
<p>One, if not the most, important part of OKRs is to focus on what truly matters. If every department or team has its own objective, you are diluting the overarching company vision.</p>
<p>Imagine an orchestra where each section plays its distinct solo simultaneously. An overflow of objectives risks discord instead of harmony.</p>
<h2>Way Too Many OKRs</h2>
<p>Going deeper, if each member charts their own course, the essence of collaboration and alignment is lost. OKRs should unify, not segregate and create isolated islands of individual goals.</p>
<p>It’s comparable to each musician playing their own tune. The outcome? A confusing mishmash of sounds.</p>
<h2>You Have Zero Cross Company OKRs</h2>
<p>It’s a misstep to think only in departmental silos. Cross-functional OKRs ensure that teams collaborate and break down walls. They push for a unity that’s essential for the larger vision and ensure that the organization’s various parts move cohesively.</p>
<p>If the woodwind section ignored the strings, the result would be disjointed. Collaboration across all teams is essential for a full, rich sound.</p>
<h2>No Alignment During Planning</h2>
<p>If all musicians only knew the finale, like reaching a C#, and then individually navigating there. Then set off to work towards that end note in whatever tempo and rhythm pattern they felt like. The performance would be erratic. Similarly, alignment discussions during the planning phase are crucial to ensure everyone is on the same page.</p>
<h2>Too Late Alignment</h2>
<p>What if alignment occurred mid-performance? Each section would be on its own journey, but to reach that climactic crescendo, they’d need to synchronize both in tempo and their position within the piece. Alignment should be foundational, not an afterthought.</p>
<h2>The OKRs are Cascading</h2>
<p>Envision a symphony dwindling from a full ensemble to solo drums. The music loses its essence. Similarly, in OKRs, the cascading model, where objectives trickle down layer by layer, risks distorting the primary goal. Instead, OKRs should be co-crafted, engaging every tier from the beginning.</p>
<h2>Time to fine-tune your OKRs</h2>
<p>In essence, the value of OKRs, much like a symphony, lies in alignment, cooperation, and clarity. They are the guiding script for an organizational magnum opus. If your organizational tune feels amiss, perhaps it’s time to fine-tune your OKRs.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>We’ve all been there, dreading this awful retrospective of a project or sprint gone completely off the rails. We probably learnt a lot, but the main gut feeling can be summarized in “Ouch”.</p>
<p>Running a successful retrospective in these situations can be somewhat challenging, especially if you want the team to continue being a team at the end of it.</p>
<p>Here are some important elements on how to run a retrospective that will not end in disaster.</p>
<h2>Check your heads and reset your thoughts</h2>
<p>Whether you have your retro in the morning, in the afternoon or late in the evening, people need to reset their heads to the retrospective. Maybe they’ve had a crazy commute, had to wait for lunch for 30 minutes and then wolfed it within 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Asking icebreaker question is an easy way fast way of resetting your mind. Some dislike them and think the icebreakers are a waste of time, even then, the moment they start to think about “how silly the icebreaker are”… that’s when it has done its magic. It made them focus their thoughts on something else.</p>
<h2>Safe from harm</h2>
<p>Make the retro a safe place for improvement by stating that we believe and trust that everyone did the best they could with the information and knowledge they had at the time.</p>
<p>Every now and then I state the The Prime Directive written by Norm Kerth in his book Project Retrospectives: A Handbook for Team Reviews.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Start with the positives alone</h2>
<p>This is one most important part of this retrospective. It is super easy to go into all things negative about a disastrous project, but by focusing on good and great achievements as a separate part of the retrospective we will have a record of what we experienced or learnt that felt important to the team.</p>
<p>Run an exercise writing stickies on the topic of everything good about the project.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before we get going with the nitty gritty of the project we need to remind ourself of everything that was really good with the project, so that we do not forget it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let each member walk through their positive learnings from the project.</p>
<p>Group the stickies and ask the group to reflect on them and ask if there is anything that we need to add, again “so we don’t forget about it”.</p>
<h2>The improvements and the purely bad</h2>
<p>With some positivity towards the project you can now run a usual retro, such as “The Good, The Bad, The Ugly”, “Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed For” or “Keep, Add, More, Less”. But remember that there is no need to run “The positives” from those retros, since you’ve already asked for them.</p>
<p>Similar to the previous, let each member walk through their notes. Group and reflect. Are there any action points to bring forward to the next sprint or project?</p>
<h2>End with the positives</h2>
<p>Now you hopefully have a whiteboard full of notes. Positive learnings, bad experiences we don’t want again and things we can improve.</p>
<p>Summarize and end the session by stating: This was a challenging sprint/project, we are pretty awesome that pulled through it. Re-iterate the action points on what we can do to get better, and focus a bit on all the things we’ve that was good and great at the end.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In smaller companies and start-ups it is fairly common that everyone does everything and try to chip in to stay alive. CTO, CPO, Head of Product and Head of Engineering is probably even the same person.</p>
<p>As the company grows, the need for more clarified positions comes apparent. Someone that used to be Product Manager, Team Lead and Engineer now needs to focus fully on where they make most value and this opens up for others to fill their shoes with any of their other roles.</p>
<p>Filling the shoes of a previous multitasker can become quite tricky, since the people who depend on you could hold you responsible for many of the responsibilities the previous person had.</p>
<p>Enter the <strong>Roles and Responsibilities</strong> workshop to clarify this.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’ve run a couple of different session’s of this workshop and it depends a bit on the attendees current roles. With plenty of people and many roles you try to dissociate the person from the role to identify the things they do, that probably needs to get done, but might not part of their role. With plenty of people with the same role you focus on what some people do in their role that others don’t.</p>
<p>Both of them is to clarify what is expected within your role and to clarify what else you do that is not part of it.</p>
<h2>“Plenty of people and many roles to clarify”-session</h2>
<p><strong>1. Add all names to a board.</strong></p>
<p>Fairly simple, no explanation needed.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.mattias.blog/filling_1.png" alt="Add All Names" title="Add All Names"></p>
<p><strong>2. Take 10 minutes and write up everything that you feel you are responsible for</strong></p>
<p>A lot of stress comes from uncertain responsibilities, things you think you are accountable to do but possibly don’t have a mandate to do.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.mattias.blog/filling_2.png" alt="What are your responsibilities" title="What are your responsibilities"></p>
<p><strong>3. Take 10 minutes to write up responsibilities that you think the others have.</strong></p>
<p>Now it’s time for the other members to give their point of view of what is missing or needs highlighting.<br>
<img src="https://media.mattias.blog/filling_3.png" alt="What others respond" title="What others respond"></p>
<p><strong>4. Switch the names to the job title that person has</strong></p>
<p>The twist comes when you dissociate the person with their role.<br>
<img src="https://media.mattias.blog/filling_4.png" alt="Dissociate the person with the role" title="Dissociate the person with the role"></p>
<p><strong>5. That should not be part of your role!</strong></p>
<p>With the roles, instead of names, on top of the column the team goes through all notes and identify the odd responsibilities. Should they be part of that role? Should someone else do it?</p>
<p><img src="https://media.mattias.blog/filling_5.png" alt="What should not be part of that responsibility" title="What should not be part of that responsibility"></p>
<p>Closing the session you identify next steps. How do you follow through on the changes in responsibility?</p>

<h2>“Plenty of people with the same role”-session</h2>
<p><strong>1. Add all names to a board</strong></p>
<p>Yup, just do it.<br>
<img src="https://media.mattias.blog/filling_2_1.png" alt="Add all names" title="Add all names"></p>
<p><strong>2. Take 10 minutes and write up everything that you feel you are responsible for</strong></p>
<p>A lot of stress comes from uncertain responsibilities. Things that you feel that you are responsible for but possibly not have a mandate to do.<br>

<p><strong>3. Switch the names of the columns</strong></p>
<p>Similar to <strong>plenty of people and many roles session</strong> there is a twist! Instead of changing the name to role, you change columns between you all.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.mattias.blog/filling_2_3.png" alt="Switch the names of the columns"></p>
<p><strong>4. That’s not part of my role!</strong></p>
<p>Look at your new column. Do you think all of these tickets should be your responsibility? Or they part of something else that the previous owner has responsibility over.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>By being aware of what others think you are responsible for and setting the right expectations when you are not responsible, will make your life much easier.</p>
<p>And remember, that stuff still needs to get done and even though tasks might not be part of your role it still might be part of your job.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>You probably have too many things that you want to achieve</p>
<p>With any project or initiatives more often than not you need to prioritize tasks, cause . With time not on our side, you need a simple way of figuring out what to focus on and what to skip.</p>
<p>Two popular matrices that are widely used are Eisenhower Matrix and Impact/Effort Matrix. With both of them you simplify and condense all data you have on a task and plot them based upon two criteria.</p>
<h2>The Eisenhower Matrix</h2>
<p>It is easy to focus on urgent tasks and never get to work on the important tasks. Focusing on putting out the fire rather than figuring out what is feeding the fire, is a sure way of continuing in fire fighting mode.</p>
<p>U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower realized that we need to spend time on important tasks and not only urgent task, that urgency alone is not the only factor on how important a task is.</p>
<p>Thus the two criteria are <strong>Urgency</strong> and <strong>Importance</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.mattias.blog/matrix_1.png" alt="The Eisenhower Matrix"></p>
<h3>Just Do It!</h3>
<p>Tasks with high importance and urgency are easy to prioritize. Just Do It!</p>
<h3>Decide When</h3>
<p>These are slightly more tricky. Since they are super important, but not that urgent, we tend to forget about them. These tasks need to be scheduled or they might end up in Just Do It!</p>
<h3>Delegate</h3>
<p>You should try to delegate the urgent but not important tasks or better yet, find a way to automate them.</p>
<h3>Try to Skip It</h3>
<p>Time wasters, ineffective meetings with no agendas, reports to fill out. Can it be removed, remove it, skip it, kill it!</p>
<h2>Impact Effort Matrix</h2>
<p>There are some similarities to Eisenhower Matrix, but the focus on Impact/Effort matrix is pretty clear from the naming. Effort is a sense of how much time a task takes or how complex it will be to solve. With Impact we try to measure the importance of the outcome.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.mattias.blog/matrix_2.png" alt="Impact Effort Matrix"></p>
<h3>Quick Wins!</h3>
<p>These low effort and high impact tasks are your low hanging fruits. Pick them quickly!</p>
<h3>Fill Ins!</h3>
<p>Things to fill out your week. Takes a little time and have some minor impact.</p>
<h3>Major Projects</h3>
<p>These tasks are probably not tasks. You’ll never get them done without planning and scheduling. Don’t do too many of these at the same time since they need a lot of focus.</p>
<h3>Not Worth It!</h3>
<p>Stop it immediately. Do nothing in this area.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Don’t spend major time on minor things” — Jim Rohn</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now take out your physical or digital sticky notes, write down your tasks. Put them on the matrix that suits your need. Then let the discussions begin, cause maybe a task that you think is a Quick Win is a Major Project for someone else.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In the article <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/the-perils-of-bad-strategy">“The perils of bad strategy”</a> the author Richard Rumelt summarizes some key concepts and stories from his excellent book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11721966-good-strategy-bad-strategy">“Good Strategy/Bad Strategy”</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A good strategy does more than urge us forward toward a goal or vision; it honestly acknowledges the challenges we face and provides an approach to overcoming them.- Richard Rumelt</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Richard Rumelt writes that a good strategy has a kernel that contains three important elements: <strong>a diagnosis</strong> that condense and explain a difficult challenge, <strong>a guiding policy</strong> on which approach you’ll take and constraints you have while trying to overcome the challenge and lastly a set of coordinated <strong>coherent actions</strong> which together will solve the challenge.</p>
<p>This sounds awfully similar to the <strong>Objective and Key Results</strong> (OKRs) popularized by the likes of Google at the end of the last century.</p>
<h2>The briefest history of OKRs.</h2>
<p>OKRs is a very popular framework for setting goals on different levels of a company. It sprung out of Peter Drucker’s “Manage by Objectives” coined in the 1950s and later improved by Andrew Growe over at Intel in the 1960s.</p>
<h2>An inspiring Objective</h2>
<p>Objectives are a description of how we see the future. A quote that is inspiring, sets a direction that is qualitative and hard to achieve.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where do we need to go?</li>
<li>Why do we need to go there?</li>
<li>What kind of constraints do we have?<br>
Similar to Richard Rumelt diagnosis and guiding policy, the Objective deals with declaring and clarifying the challenge.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The constrains of Key Results</h2>
<p>Key Results are how we measure results and progress towards achieving an Objective.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Key Results are like latitudes and logitudes in the background of Google Maps. Informing us when we’ve made wrong turns, if we’re progressing as expected and when we’ve arrived at our destination.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you write your important KRs before you dig deep into initiatives or actions will also help you from jumping to conclusions on how to solve the problem. What if there are multiple ways of getting to the goal? What if you actually arrived at your destination faster by taking another path?</p>
<p>While some part of the Objective states the guiding policy for your strategy, the Key Results are equally important as constraints.</p>
<h2>Initiatives and coherent actions</h2>
<p>Initiatives are the OKRs way of clarifying coherent actions i.e. What kind of work do we need to do to get us there?</p>
<h2>OKRs and Good Strategy</h2>
<p>Good strategy gives us clarity and acknowledges the biggest challenges we have a company. OKRs is one great way to clarify and work with that strategy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OKRs is a bridge between a Good Strategy and Execution.</p>
</blockquote>

There is an easy template or acronym that you can use for planning out your session. Each of the letters propel you into the next one.

<p>Each of the letters propel you into the next one. Intent gets you half way to what you actually want as an outcome. With that expected outcome you can start planning an agenda, where you start with the end goal in sight.</p>
<h2>Intention</h2>
<p>What do we intend with the meeting? Why even have it?</p>
<h2>Desired Outcome</h2>
<p>What specific results do we want to have achieved at the end of this meeting?</p>
<h2>Agenda</h2>
<p>What will we do at the meeting and in what order to achieve the expected results.</p>
<hr>
<p>Sometimes this is enough for a great meeting. It takes a couple of minutes to write, but it highly improves the meeting. When I facilitate longer sessions I add the last three letters of the acronym.</p>
<h2>Roles</h2>
<p>What roles and responsibilities are there for the meeting to run smoothly? Who facilitates, participates, documents? What is expected of the participants.</p>
<h2>Rules</h2>
<p>What kind of rules do we have in this meeting?</p>
<p>Should we practice active listening and not just wait for the moment to state your point?</p>
<p>Should we use some way of indicating who talks and how to hand over the mic to someone else, especially valid when doing a hybrid meeting with people both remote and on-site.</p>
<p>Should computers or mobiles be used when we run a meeting where everyone is in the same room?</p>
<p>Law of two-feet i.e. Leave if you don’t contribute?</p>
<p>How do we take minutes and where are they stored?</p>
<p>Let the participants come up with other rules that they want to include.</p>
<h2>Time</h2>
<p>How long is the meeting, will there be breaks?</p>

<h2>Fans</h2>
<p>These are the end-users of your products. They love your products, they will talk someone’s ears off evangelizing your product. They have no real impact of decisions or budget.</p>
<h2>Coaches</h2>
<p>Coaches help you navigate the map of a company. Who to talk to, when to talk to them, and what is going on at the company. “You didn’t hear it from me, but… this is what’s happening”.</p>
<h2>Champions</h2>
<p>These are the people that can take a chunk of the budget. They might not have direct authority, but they have a seat at the table when the conversations are happening. At that same table others will be advocating their favorite so make sure your champion has the correct data and arguments to advocate your product.</p>
<hr>
<p>Do you know if your advocate is really a champion, fan or coach?</p>

                    <link>https://mattias.blog/guidelines-over-processes-6bbb6c8bb336</link>
                    <description>As I mentioned in the previous post about growing pains, one regular pattern seen when growing past 50 people is the shift from direct communication to processes. While it is easy to believe that processes could solve communication and vision challenges, this is seldom the case. Hey there! You are not following the process!

                            <![CDATA[<p>As I mentioned in the <a href="https://mattias.blog/growing-pains-for-growing-companies-8665bc79c937">previous post about growing pains</a>, one regular pattern seen when growing past 50 people is the shift from direct communication to processes.</p>
<p>While it is easy to believe that processes could solve communication and vision challenges, this is seldom the case.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey there! You are not following the process!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure, we could always point at the process and say <em>“Hey there! You are not following the process!“</em> And hope that your colleagues changes behavior, but that usually has no long lasting effects, especially when there is a believe that “what got us here, will take us there”.</p>
<p>There is a reason a company succeeds and grows, and it is probably credited with <strong>founders’ core values</strong>. Customer-centric, adaptability, collaboration, deep technical skills, “we can do it”-mentality to name just a few.</p>
<p>When these rather informal values go through the transformation to become documented processes a lot of agility and flexibility are lost on the way.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.mattias.blog/guidelines_follow_the_path.jpg" alt="The Eisenhower Matrix"><br>
<a href="https://unsplash.com/@2mduffel?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Photo by Mark Duffel on Unsplash</a></p>
<p>Rules and processes have a tendency to be absolute and we need a different way to move forward with our vision and at the same time have the opportunity to steer away from it temporarily when needed.</p>
<p>Similar to how the agile manifesto has values that captures both sides of an argument and favors one, so could a company capture its guidelines.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more. - Agile Manifesto</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead of writing a process around “Choice A versus Choice B” write guidelines with focus of picking one over the other, “Choice A over Choice B”. Making it easier transparent when we sidestep, but that is ok. Also making it easier to move forward on the vision.</p>
<p>Some examples of guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Money over Glory</li>
<li>Support existing customers over acquiring new customers</li>
<li>Subscription over One-Time Payment</li>
<li>Improve existing products over Building new products</li>
<li>MVP over Big Bang</li>
<li>Collaboration over Silos</li>
<li>Team players over Rock stars</li>
<li>Done over Perfect</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to the agile manifesto, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.</p>
<p>While there is value in formal processes, I value the agility in guidelines more.</p>

                    <description>Read this great article about Molly Graham’s experiences with companies facing challenges during rapid growth and hiring. Managers should focus on normalizing and confirming feelings, their employees feel when change happens in at a rapid pace. As a leader, you want to head it off at the pass and proactively say, ‘Hey, this is what you can expect to feel during this time of growth. It’s pretty universal‘. - Molly Graham Rapid growth could mean that your employees are challenged by changes in...</description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Read this great article about <a href="https://review.firstround.com/give-away-your-legos-and-other-commandments-for-scaling-startups">Molly Graham’s experiences</a> with companies facing challenges during rapid growth and hiring. Managers should focus on normalizing and confirming feelings, their employees feel when change happens in at a rapid pace.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a leader, you want to head it off at the pass and proactively say, ‘Hey, this is what you can expect to feel during this time of growth. It’s pretty universal‘. - Molly Graham</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rapid growth could mean that your employees are challenged by changes in roles or responsibilities. Certain parts of their work or responsibility, where they have done an excellent job, no longer belong to them. By focusing on the vision and the future and help the picturing it, it eases the transition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the best techniques for getting people through job-change anxiety is to help them picture the reality of their next job and the size of the opportunity. - Molly Graham</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Graham also sees patterns when companies grow beyond a certain amount of employees.</p>
<h3>We used to be a family, now we’re a company!?</h3>
<p>Around 30 to 50 employees you go from being a family where everyone knows each other and can strike up a conversation at any time. Communication is easy and direct. At 50 employees you’ve reached the level where you are a real company, not just a small team.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything that used to come naturally is now a struggle. - Molly Graham</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While it is easy to focus on defining complex processes to overcome the need for a clearer way of working, you should focus on the principles and guidelines you wish to follow.</p>
<h3>We can still change the vision and mission with ease</h3>
<p>From 50 to 250 it is still easy to get your message across the company and to change the trajectory of the company. Beyond 250 employees it mostly depends on what you did well before.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lot of how this phase feels has to do with how good of a ‘parent’ you were earlier on. - Molly Graham</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>In summary</h3>
<p>How we hire and look after the first 100 employees will have an impact and set the tone for the next 200. Be good early on, establish guidelines rather than processes. Be transparent and open about growing pains.</p>

<p>I found this great TedX talk by Professor Amy Edmondson that coined the term back in 1999.</p>

<p>My main takeaways on building psychological safety are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Frame the work as a learning problem, not an execution problem.</strong> We have never been in this situation before, or for long, and we need everyone’s brains and voices in the game.</li>
<li><strong>Acknowledge your own fallibility.</strong> Say simple things like “I might miss something, I need to hear from you…“.</li>
<li><strong>Model curiosity.</strong> Ask a lot of questions.</li>
</ol>
